[King Arthur Gold](https://kag2d.com/en/), also known as KAG, is a free Medieval
Build n'Kill Multiplayer Game with Destructible Environments.

Construct freeform forts as a medieval Builder, fight in sword duels as a Knight
or snipe with your bow as an Archer. KAG blends the cooperative aspects of Lost
Vikings, mashes them with the full destructibility of Worms and the visual style
and action of Metal Slug, brought to you by the creators of Soldat.
