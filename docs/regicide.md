[Regicide](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/) is a wonderful cooperative card
game for 1 to 4 players. It's awesome how they've built such a rich game dynamic
with a normal deck of cards. Even if you can play it with any deck, I suggest to
buy [the deck they sell](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/buy-regicide) because
their cards are magnificent and they deserve the money for their impressive
game. Another thing I love about them is that even if you can't or don't want to
pay for the game, they give the [rules for
free](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/assets/RegicideRulesA4.pdf?v=2).

If you don't like reading the rules directly from their pdf (although it's quite
short), they explain them in [this
video](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/regicide).

# Variations

Each game is different and challenging despite your experience, even so, I've thought
that to make it even more varied and rich, the players can use one or many of
the next expansions:

* [Situation modifiers](#situation-modifiers).
* [Player modifiers](#player-modifiers).

Each of the expansions make the game both more different and more complex, so
it's not suggested to use them all at the same time, try one, and once the
players are used to it, add another one.

!!! note "These expansions are yet untested ideas, so they might break the playability."

    If you have any suggestion please [contact me](contact.md) or open a pull
    request.

Throughout the next sections you'll encounter the `1 x level` notation to define
the times an action will take place. It's assumed that the level of the enemies
is:

| Card | Level |
| ---  | ---   |
| J    | 1     |
| Q    | 2     |
| K    | 3     |

## Situation modifiers

You can spice up each game by making each round different by applying situation
modifiers. Once a new enemy arrives the scene, roll up a dice to choose one of
the next situations:

1. *Disloyal*: The fighters you use in this round that match the enemy's suit will
   be disloyal to you and will join the enemy's ranks in the next round. The
   player will receive damage of both the enemy and their minions. Players will
   need to kill their minions before they hit the royal enemy.
1. *Cornered*: You're cornered and the enemy archers are firing you. At the start of
    each player turn, it takes `2 x level` amount of damage.
1. *Exterminator*: When it deals damage, `1 x level` of the player discarded
   cards are taken out of the game.
1. *Enemy ambush*: When the enemy enters the scene, it deals `2 x level` amount of
    damage to the players.
1. *Enemy Spy*: It has moles inside your ranks. When it comes to scene, you
    drop `1 x level` amount of cards of that suit.
1. *Necromancer*: When it hits the first player, the smallest discarded card
   goes to the enemy ranks instead of the discarded pile. Players need to kill
   this minion before hitting the enemy.
1. *Represor Enemy*: It kills `1 x level` people from the tavern at the start of each
    player's turn.
1. *Dexterous Enemy*: It has a `20% x level` of chances to dodge the player's
   attack.
1. *Quick Enemy*: The enemy hits you in the first phase of your turn, instead of
the last.
1. *Stronger Enemy*: It deals `2 x level` more damage.
1. *Tougher Enemy*: It has `3 x level` more health.

2. *Blind Enemy*: It attacks to any player that makes a noise in addition to the
   player that is currently fighting it.
2. *Random Enemy*: There is no logic in it's actions, instead of attacking the
   player who is playing, it attacks a random one.
2. *Uneventful round*: Nothing happens, play the round as the vanilla game.

3. *Softer Enemy*: It has `3 x level` less health.
3. *Weaker Enemy*: It deals `2 x level` less damage.
3. *Clumsy Enemy*: It has a `20% x level` of chances to fail when hitting the
   players.
3. *Resistance Spies*: You have moles inside the enemy ranks that removes their
   suit invulnerability.
3. *Ambush*: When the enemy enters the scene, you all deal `2 x level` amount of
    damage to the enemy.
3. *Communist/Anarchist "enemy"*: It really is on your side to bring down the
   monarchy, so you all get a `1 x level` to all the cards you play, and a `2
   x level` to it's suit.
3. *Enemy Cornered*: You cornered the enemy, and your archers are firing them. At the start of
    each player turn, the enemy takes `2 x level` amount of damage.
3. *Loyal*: The fighters you use in this round that match the enemy's suit will
   be loyal to you and won't be moved to the discarded pile at the end of the
   round. On the first round of each player, they'll use both the card in the
   table and the one that they use.

## Player modifiers

At the start of the game players can decide their suit, they will get a bonus on
the played cards of their suit, and a penalization on the opposite suit. The
opposite suits are:

* ♠ opposite of ♥
* ♣ opposite of ♦

The bonus depends on the level of the enemy being:

* J: +1 or -1
* Q: +2 or -2
* K: +3 or -3

Imagine that I've chosen ♦ as my suit, if I were to play:

* The 8♦ against a J♥, I'd draw `8+1` cards from the deck, and deal `8+1` damage
* The 7♣ against a Q♠, I'd deal 10 of damage `(7-2) * 2`.
* The 4♦4♥ against a K♣, I'd heal and draw 11 cards `(4+4+3)`.
* The 4♦4♣ against a K♠, I'd draw 8 cards `(4+4+3-3)` and deal 16 of damage.

I haven't decide yet if the bonus should apply at the time of receiving damage,
we played one without counting and it was playable, will test the other soon.

## Player classes

* Create player classes: Each player class has abilities that can use `X` amount
    of times in the match:

    * Archer:
    * Healer:
    * Paladin:
    * Warrior:
    * Wizard:
