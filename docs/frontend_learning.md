This section is the particularization of the [Development learning
article](code_learning.md) for a frontend developer, in particular
a [Vue](vuejs.md) developer.

# [What is a Frontend developer?](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_frontenddev.asp)

A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. It's
main responsibility is to create what the user sees.

The basic languages for Front-End Development are [HTML](html.md),
[CSS](css.md), and [JavaScript](javascript.md). Nowadays writing interfaces with
only the basic languages makes no sense as there are other languages and
frameworks that make better and quicker solutions. One of them is
[Vue](vuejs.md), which is the one I learnt, so the whole document will be
focused on this path, nevertheless there are others popular ones like:
[Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_bootstrap.asp),
[React](react.md), [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) or
[Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp).

The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how
a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.

# Roadmap

## First steps

### Setup your development environment

### Learn the basics

In order to write Vue code you first need to understand the foundations it's
built upon, that means learning the basics of:

* [HTML](html.md): For example following the [W3
    tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), at least until the
    HTML Forms section.
* [CSS](css.md): For example following the [W3
    tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) until CSS Advanced.
* [Javascript](javascript.md): For example using the [W3
    tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) until JS Versions.

If you follow other [learning methods](code_learning.md#learning-methods), make
sure that they cover more less the same concepts.
