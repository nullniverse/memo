# Saving water

Here are some small things I'm doing to save some water each day:

- Use the watering can or a bucket to gather the shower water until it's warm
  enough. I use this water to flush the toilet. It would be best if it were
  possible to fill up the toilet's deposit, but it's not easy.
- Use a glass of water to wet the toothbrush and rinse my mouth instead of using
  running water.
