# [Extend the life of your battery](https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210224685-Getting-started-guide)

[Research](https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210224725-Charging-research-and-methodology)
has shown that keeping your battery charged between 0% and 80% can make your
battery's lifespan last 2x longer than when you use a full battery cycle from
0-100%.

As a non root user you can
[install Accubattery](https://www.getdroidtips.com/custom-battery-charge-limit-android/)
(not in F-droid :( ) to get an alarm when the battery reaches 80% so that you
can manually unplug it. Instead of leaving the mobile charge in the night and
stay connected at 100% a lot of hours until you unplug, charge it throughout the
day.
