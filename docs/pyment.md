[Pyment](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment) is a python3 program to
automatically create, update or convert docstrings in existing Python files,
managing several styles.

# [Installation](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment#id3)

```bash
pip install pyment
```

# Usage

```bash
$: pyment  myfile.py    # will generate a patch
$: pyment -w myfile.py  # will overwrite the file
```

As of 2021-11-17, the program is not production ready yet for me, I've tested it
in one of my projects and found some bugs that needed to be fixed before it's
usable. Despite the number of stars, it looks like the development pace has
dropped dramatically, so it needs our help to get better :).
