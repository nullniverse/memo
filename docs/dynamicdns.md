[Dynamic DNS (DDNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) is a method of
automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name Server (DNS), often in
real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames,
addresses or other information.

There are different DDNS providers, I use [Duckdns](https://www.duckdns.org) as
it is easy to setup and the Linuxserver people have a [docker that makes it
work](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/duckdns/).
