As humans diet is an important factor in our health, we need to eat daily around
three times a day, as such, each week we need to invest time into managing how
to get food in front of us. Tasks like thinking what do you want to eat, buying
the ingredients and cooking them make use a non negligible amount of time. Also
something to keep in mind, is that eating is one of the great pleasures in our
lives, so doing it poorly is a waste. The last part of the equation is that to
eat good you either need time or money.

This article explores my thoughts and findings on how to optimize the use of
time, money and mental load in food management while keeping the desired level
of quality to enjoy each meal, being healthy and following the principles of
ecology and sustainability. I'm no expert at all on either of these topics. I'm
learning and making my mind while writing these lines.
