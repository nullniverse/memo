[Book binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookbinding) is the process of
physically assembling a book of codex format from an ordered stack of paper
sheets that are folded together into sections called signatures or sometimes
left as a stack of individual sheets. Several signatures are then bound together
along one edge with a thick needle and sturdy thread.
