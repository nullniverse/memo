[Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) is a Vim-like interface for Firefox, inspired by Vimperator/Pentadactyl. 

# Usage

## [Select text from the page](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/32)

You can either use `/` to search for the text and you'll be directly in `Visual mode` or you can use `v` to trigger the hints in the page, once you've selected your hint you can move around as you'd normally would in vim.
