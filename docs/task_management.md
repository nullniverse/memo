[Task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management) is the process
of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing,
tracking, and reporting. Task management can help either individual achieve
goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the
accomplishment of collective goals.

You can address task management at different levels. High level management
ensures that you choose your tasks in order to accomplish a goal, low level
management helps you get things done.

When you do task management well, you benefit from:

* Reducing your mental load, so you can use those resources doing productive
    work.
* Improving your efficiency.
* Making more realistic estimations, thus meeting the commited deadlines.
* Finishing what you start.
* Knowing you're working towards your ultimate goals
* Stop feeling lost or overburdened.
* Make context switches cheaper.

On the other side, task management done wrong can consume your willpower in the
exchange of lost time and a confused mind.

The tricky reality is that the factors that decide if you do it right or wrong
are different for every person, and even for a person it may change over the
time or mood states. That's why I follow the thought that task management is
a tool that is meant to help you. If it's not, you need to change your
system until it does.

A side effect is that you have to tailor your task management system yourself.
It doesn't matter how good the systems you find in the internet are, until you start getting
your hands dirty, you won't know if they works for you. So instead of trying to
discover the perfect solution, start with one that introduces the least friction
in your current workflow, and evolve from that point guided by the faults you
find. Forget about instant solutions, this is a never ending marathon. Make sure
that each step is small and easy, otherwise you will get tired too soon.

I haven't written a guide yet on how to give your first steps, but you could
start by following [a simple workflow](task_workflows.md) with [simple
tools](task_tools.md).
