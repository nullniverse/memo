# [Substract two paths](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10149263/extract-a-part-of-the-filepath-a-directory-in-python)

It can also framed to how to get the relative path between two absolute paths:

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> p = Path('/home/lyz/')
>>> h = Path('/home/')
>>> p.relative_to(h)
PosixPath('lyz')
```

# [Move a file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8858008/how-to-move-a-file-in-python)

Use one of the following

```python
import os
import shutil

os.rename("path/to/current/file.foo", "path/to/new/destination/for/file.foo")
os.replace("path/to/current/file.foo", "path/to/new/destination/for/file.foo")
shutil.move("path/to/current/file.foo", "path/to/new/destination/for/file.foo")
```

# [Print an exception](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1483429/how-do-i-print-an-exception-in-python)

## Using the logging module

Logging an exception can be done with the module-level function
`logging.exception()` like so:

```python
import logging

try:
    1 / 0
except BaseException:
    logging.exception("An exception was thrown!")
```

```
ERROR:root:An exception was thrown!
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ".../Desktop/test.py", line 4, in <module>
    1/0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Notes

- The function `logging.exception()` should only be called from an exception
  handler.

- The logging module should not be used inside a logging handler to avoid a
  `RecursionError`.

It's also possible to log the exception with another log level but still show
the exception details by using the keyword argument `exc_info=True`, like so:

```python
logging.critical("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.error("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.warning("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.info("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.debug("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)

# or the general form
logging.log(level, "An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
```

## With the traceback module

The `traceback` module provides methods for formatting and printing exceptions
and their tracebacks, e.g. this would print exception like the default handler
does:

```python
import traceback

try:
    1 / 0
except Exception:
    traceback.print_exc()
```

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\scripts\divide_by_zero.py", line 4, in <module>
    1/0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

# [Get common elements of two lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13962781/common-elements-in-two-lists-python)

```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b']
>>> b = ['c', 'd', 'b']
>>> set(a) & set(b)
{'b'}
```

# [Get the difference of two lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2070643/subtracting-two-lists-in-python)

If we want to substract the elements of one list from the other you can use:

```python
for x in b:
  if x in a:
    a.remove(x)
```

# [Recursively find files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2186525/how-to-use-glob-to-find-files-recursively)

## Using `pathlib.Path.rglob`

```python
from pathlib import Path

for path in Path("src").rglob("*.c"):
    print(path.name)
```

If you don't want to use `pathlib`, use can use `glob.glob('**/*.c')`, but don't
forget to pass in the recursive keyword parameter and it will use inordinate
amount of time on large directories.

## os.walk

For older Python versions, use `os.walk` to recursively walk a directory and
`fnmatch.filter` to match against a simple expression:

```python
import fnmatch
import os

matches = []
for root, dirnames, filenames in os.walk("src"):
    for filename in fnmatch.filter(filenames, "*.c"):
        matches.append(os.path.join(root, filename))
```

# [Pad a string with spaces](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309255/how-to-pad-a-string-to-a-fixed-length-with-spaces-in-python)

```python
>>> name = 'John'
>>> name.ljust(15)
'John           '
```

# [Get hostname of the machine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4271740/how-can-i-use-python-to-get-the-system-hostname)

Any of the next three options:

```python
import os

os.uname()[1]

import platform

platform.node()

import socket

socket.gethostname()
```

# [Pathlib make parent directories if they don't exist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50110800/python-pathlib-make-directories-if-they-don-t-exist)

```python
pathlib.Path("/tmp/sub1/sub2").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

From the
[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir):

- If `parents` is `true`, any missing parents of this path are created as
  needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into
  account (mimicking the POSIX `mkdir -p` command).

- If `parents` is `false` (the default), a missing parent raises
  `FileNotFoundError`.

- If `exist_ok` is `false` (the default), `FileExistsError` is raised if the
  target directory already exists.

- If `exist_ok` is `true`, `FileExistsError` exceptions will be ignored (same
  behavior as the POSIX `mkdir -p` command), but only if the last path component
  is not an existing non-directory file.

# [Pathlib touch a file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.touch)

Create a file at this given path.

```python
pathlib.Path("/tmp/file.txt").touch(exist_ok=True)
```

If the file already exists, the function succeeds if `exist_ok` is `true` (and
its modification time is updated to the current time), otherwise
`FileExistsError` is raised.

If the parent directory doesn't exist you need to create it first.

```python
global_conf_path = xdg_home / "autoimport" / "config.toml"
global_conf_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True)
global_conf_path.touch(exist_ok=True)
```

# [Pad integer with zeros](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39402795/how-to-pad-a-string-with-leading-zeros-in-python-3)

```python
>>> length = 1
>>> print(f'length = {length:03}')
length = 001
```

# [Print datetime with a defined format](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/311627/how-to-print-a-date-in-a-regular-format)

```python
now = datetime.now()
today.strftime("We are the %d, %b %Y")
```

Where the datetime format is a string built from
[these directives](#parse-a-datetime-from-a-string).

# [Print string with asciiart](https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/ascii-art)

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```

```python
from pyfiglet import figlet_format

print(figlet_format("09 : 30"))
```

If you want to change the default width of 80 caracteres use:

```python
from pyfiglet import Figlet

f = Figlet(font="standard", width=100)
print(f.renderText("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"))
```

# Print specific time format

```python
datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
```

# [Get an instance of an Enum by value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29503339/how-to-get-all-values-from-python-enum-class)

If you want to initialize a pydantic model with an `Enum` but all you have is
the value of the `Enum` then you need to create a method to get the correct
Enum. Otherwise `mypy` will complain that the type of the assignation is `str`
and not `Enum`.

So if the model is the next one:

```python
class ServiceStatus(BaseModel):
    """Model the docker status of a service."""

    name: str
    environment: Environment
```

You can't do `ServiceStatus(name='test', environment='production')`. you need to
add the `get_by_value` method to the `Enum` class:

```python
class Environment(str, Enum):
    """Set the possible environments."""

    STAGING = "staging"
    PRODUCTION = "production"

    @classmethod
    def get_by_value(cls, value: str) -> Enum:
        """Return the Enum element that meets a value"""
        return [member for member in cls if member.value == value][0]
```

Now you can do:

```python
ServiceStatus(name="test", environment=Environment.get_by_value("production"))
```

# [Fix R1728: Consider using a generator](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/refactor/consider-using-generator.html)

Removing `[]` inside calls that can use containers or generators should be
considered for performance reasons since a generator will have an upfront cost
to pay. The performance will be better if you are working with long lists or
sets.

Problematic code:

```python
list([0 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
tuple([0 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
sum([y**2 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
max([y**2 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
min([y**2 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
```

Correct code:

```python
list(0 for y in list(range(10)))
tuple(0 for y in list(range(10)))
sum(y**2 for y in list(range(10)))
max(y**2 for y in list(range(10)))
min(y**2 for y in list(range(10)))
```

# [Fix W1510: Using subprocess.run without explicitly set check is not recommended](https://pycodequ.al/docs/pylint-messages/w1510-subprocess-run-check.html)

The `run` call in the example will succeed whether the command is successful or
not. This is a problem because we silently ignore errors.

```python
import subprocess


def example():
    proc = subprocess.run("ls")
    return proc.stdout
```

When we pass `check=True`, the behavior changes towards raising an exception
when the return code of the command is non-zero.

# [Use pipes with subprocess](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13332268/how-to-use-subprocess-command-with-pipes)

To use pipes with subprocess you need to use the flag `shell=True` which is
[a bad idea](https://github.com/duo-labs/dlint/blob/master/docs/linters/DUO116.md).
Instead you should use two processes and link them together in python:

```python
ps = subprocess.Popen(("ps", "-A"), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
output = subprocess.check_output(("grep", "process_name"), stdin=ps.stdout)
ps.wait()
```

# [Pass input to the stdin of a subprocess](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8475290/how-do-i-write-to-a-python-subprocess-stdin)

# [Copy and paste from clipboard](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11063458/python-script-to-copy-text-to-clipboard)

You can use
[many libraries](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-copy-to-clipboard/)
to do it, but if you don't want to add any other dependencies you can use
`subprocess run`.

To copy from the `selection` clipboard, assuming you've got `xclip` installed,
you could do:

```python
subprocess.run(
    ["xclip", "-selection", "clipboard", "-i"],
    input="text to be copied",
    text=True,
    check=True,
)
```

To paste it:

```python
subprocess.check_output(["xclip", "-o", "-selection", "clipboard"]).decode("utf-8")
```

# [Initialize a dataclass with kwargs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55099243/python3-dataclass-with-kwargsasterisk)

If you care about accessing attributes by name, or if you can't distinguish
between known and unknown arguments during initialisation, then your last resort
without rewriting `__init__` (which pretty much defeats the purpose of using
dataclasses in the first place) is writing a `@classmethod`:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from inspect import signature


@dataclass
class Container:
    user_id: int
    body: str

    @classmethod
    def from_kwargs(cls, **kwargs):
        # fetch the constructor's signature
        cls_fields = {field for field in signature(cls).parameters}

        # split the kwargs into native ones and new ones
        native_args, new_args = {}, {}
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            if key in cls_fields:
                native_args[key] = value
            else:
                new_args[key] = value

        # use the native ones to create the class ...
        ret = cls(**native_args)

        # ... and add the new ones by hand
        for new_key, new_value in new_args.items():
            setattr(ret, new_key, new_value)
        return ret
```

Usage:

```python
params = {"user_id": 1, "body": "foo", "bar": "baz", "amount": 10}
Container(**params)  # still doesn't work, raises a TypeError
c = Container.from_kwargs(**params)
print(c.bar)  # prints: 'baz'
```

# [Define a property of a class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/128573/using-property-on-classmethods/64738850#64738850)

If you're using Python 3.9 or above you can directly use the decorators:

```python
class G:
    @classmethod
    @property
    def __doc__(cls):
        return f"A doc for {cls.__name__!r}"
```

If you're not, you can define the decorator `classproperty`:

```python
# N801: class name 'classproperty' should use CapWords convention, but it's a decorator.
# C0103: Class name "classproperty" doesn't conform to PascalCase naming style but it's
# a decorator.
class classproperty:  # noqa: N801, C0103
    """Define a class property.

    From Python 3.9 you can directly use the decorators directly.

    class G:
        @classmethod
        @property
        def __doc__(cls):
            return f'A doc for {cls.__name__!r}'
    """

    def __init__(self, function: Callable[..., Any]) -> None:
        """Initialize the decorator."""
        self.function = function

    # ANN401: Any not allowed in typings, but I don't know how to narrow the hints in
    # this case.

        """Return the desired value."""
        return self.function(owner_self)
```

But you'll run into the
`W0143: Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis? (comparison-with-callable)`
mypy error when using it to compare the result of the property with anything, as
it doesn't detect it's a property instead of a method.

duplicates = [number for number in numbers if numbers.count(number) > 1]
unique_duplicates = list(set(duplicates))

# Returns: [2, 3, 5]
```

If you want to count the number of occurrences of each duplicate, you can use:

```python
from collections import Counter

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 7]

counts = dict(Counter(numbers))
duplicates = {key: value for key, value in counts.items() if value > 1}

# Returns: {2: 2, 3: 4, 5: 3}
```

To remove the duplicates use a combination of `list` and `set`:

```python
unique = list(set(numbers))

# Returns: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# [Change the working directory of a test](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62044541/change-pytest-working-directory-to-test-case-directory)

The following function-level fixture will change to the test case directory, run

side-effects.

```python
@pytest.fixture(name="change_test_dir")
def change_test_dir_(request: SubRequest) -> Any:
    os.chdir(request.fspath.dirname)
    yield
    os.chdir(request.config.invocation_dir)
```

- `request` is a built-in pytest fixture
- `fspath` is the `LocalPath` to the test module being executed
- `dirname` is the directory of the test module
- `request.config.invocationdir` is the folder from which pytest was executed
- `request.config.rootdir` is the pytest root, doesn't change based on where you
  run pytest. Not used here, but could be useful.

Any processes that are kicked off by the test will use the test case folder as
their working directory and copy their logs, outputs, etc. there, regardless of
where the test suite was executed.

# [Remove a substring from the end of a string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1038824/how-do-i-remove-a-substring-from-the-end-of-a-string)

On Python 3.9 and newer you can use the `removeprefix` and `removesuffix`
methods to remove an entire substring from either side of the string:

```python
url = "abcdc.com"
url.removesuffix(".com")  # Returns 'abcdc'
url.removeprefix("abcdc.")  # Returns 'com'
```

On Python 3.8 and older you can use `endswith` and slicing:

```python
url = "abcdc.com"
if url.endswith(".com"):
    url = url[:-4]
```

Or a regular expression:

```python
import re

url = "abcdc.com"
url = re.sub("\.com$", "", url)

you're doing.

# [When to use `isinstance` and when to use `type`](https://towardsdatascience.com/difference-between-type-and-isinstance-in-python-47fae6fbb068)

`isinstance` takes into account inheritance, while `type` doesn't. So if we have
the next code:

```python
class Shape:
    pass


class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        self.area = length * width

    def get_area(self):
        return self.length * self.width


class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, length):
        Rectangle.__init__(self, length, length)
```

And we want to check if an object `a = Square(5)` is of type `Rectangle`, we
could not use `isinstance` because it'll return `True` as it's a subclass of
`Rectangle`:

```python
>>> isinstance(a, Rectangle)
True
```

Instead, use a comparison with `type`:

```python
>>> type(a) == Rectangle
False
```

Invalid value for requires_dist. Error: Can't have direct dependency: 'deepdiff @ git+git://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff@master'
```

It looks like this is a conscious decision on the PyPI side. Basically, they
don't want pip to reach out to URLs outside their site when installing from
PyPI.

An ugly patch is to install the dependencies in a `PostInstall` custom script in
the `setup.py` of your program:

```python
from setuptools.command.install import install
from subprocess import getoutput

# ignore: cannot subclass install, has type Any. And what would you do?
class PostInstall(install):  # type: ignore
    """Install direct dependency.

    Pypi doesn't allow uploading packages with direct dependencies, so we need to
    install them manually.
    """

    def run(self) -> None:
        """Install dependencies."""
        install.run(self)
        print(getoutput("pip install git+git://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff@master"))


setup(cmdclass={"install": PostInstall})
```

Warning: It may not work! Last time I used this solution, when I added the
library on a `setup.py` the direct dependencies weren't installed :S

# [Get the week number of a datetime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2600775/how-to-get-week-number-in-python)

`datetime.datetime` has a `isocalendar()` method, which returns a tuple
containing the calendar week:

```python
>>> import datetime
>>> datetime.datetime(2010, 6, 16).isocalendar()[1]
24
```

`datetime.date.isocalendar()` is an instance-method returning a tuple containing
year, weeknumber and weekday in respective order for the given date instance.

# [Get the monday of a week number](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17087314/get-date-from-week-number)

A week number is not enough to generate a date; you need a day of the week as
well. Add a default:

```python
import datetime

d = "2013-W26"
r = datetime.datetime.strptime(d + "-1", "%Y-W%W-%w")
```

The `-1` and `-%w` pattern tells the parser to pick the Monday in that week.

# [Group or sort a list of dictionaries or objects by a specific key](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html)

Python lists have a built-in `list.sort()` method that modifies the list
in-place. There is also a `sorted()` built-in function that builds a new sorted
list from an iterable.

## [Sorting basics](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sorting-basics)

A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the `sorted()` function. It
returns a new sorted list:

```python
>>> sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## [Key functions](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions)

Both `list.sort()` and `sorted()` have a `key` parameter to specify a function
(or other callable) to be called on each list element prior to making
comparisons.

For example, here’s a case-insensitive string comparison:

```python
>>> sorted("This is a test string from Andrew".split(), key=str.lower)
['a', 'Andrew', 'from', 'is', 'string', 'test', 'This']
```

The value of the `key` parameter should be a function (or other callable) that
takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. This
technique is fast because the key function is called exactly once for each input
record.

A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object’s indices
as keys. For example:

```python
>>> from operator import itemgetter
>>> student_tuples = [
    ('john', 'A', 15),
    ('jane', 'B', 12),
    ('dave', 'B', 10),
]

>>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(2))   # sort by age
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:

```python
>>> from operator import attrgetter
>>> class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade, age):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return repr((self.name, self.grade, self.age))

>>> student_objects = [
    Student('john', 'A', 15),
    Student('jane', 'B', 12),
    Student('dave', 'B', 10),
]

>>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'))   # sort by age
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

The operator module functions allow multiple levels of sorting. For example, to
sort by grade then by age:

```python
>>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(1,2))
[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]

>>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('grade', 'age'))
[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]
```

## [Sorts stability and complex sorts](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts)

Sorts are guaranteed to be stable. That means that when multiple records have
the same key, their original order is preserved.

```python
>>> data = [('red', 1), ('blue', 1), ('red', 2), ('blue', 2)]

>>> sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0))
[('blue', 1), ('blue', 2), ('red', 1), ('red', 2)]
```

Notice how the two records for blue retain their original order so that
`('blue', 1)` is guaranteed to precede `('blue', 2)`.

This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting
steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending grade and then
ascending age, do the age sort first and then sort again using grade:

```python
>>> s = sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'))     # sort on secondary key

>>> sorted(s, key=attrgetter('grade'), reverse=True)       # now sort on primary key, descending
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

This can be abstracted out into a wrapper function that can take a list and
tuples of field and order to sort them on multiple passes.

```python
>>> def multisort(xs, specs):
    for key, reverse in reversed(specs):
        xs.sort(key=attrgetter(key), reverse=reverse)
    return xs

>>> multisort(list(student_objects), (('grade', True), ('age', False)))
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

## [Get the attribute of an attribute](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/403421/how-to-sort-a-list-of-objects-based-on-an-attribute-of-the-objects)

To sort the list in place:

```python
ut.sort(key=lambda x: x.count, reverse=True)
```

To return a new list, use the `sorted()` built-in function:

```python
newlist = sorted(ut, key=lambda x: x.body.id_, reverse=True)
```

# Make multiline code look clean

If you need variables that contain multiline strings inside functions or methods
you need to remove the indentation

```python
def test():
    # end first line with \ to avoid the empty line!
    s = """\
hello
  world
"""
```

Which is inconvenient as it breaks some editor source code folding and it's ugly
for the eye.

The solution is to use
[`textwrap.dedent()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html)

```python
import textwrap


def test():
    # end first line with \ to avoid the empty line!
    s = """\
    hello
      world
    """
    print(repr(s))  # prints '    hello\n      world\n    '
    print(repr(textwrap.dedent(s)))  # prints 'hello\n  world\n'
```

If you forget to add the trailing `\` character of `s = '''\` or use
`s = '''hello`, you're going to have a bad time with [black](black.md).

a `break` statement.

## [Create user defined exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions)

Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class.
Exceptions should typically be derived from the `Exception` class, either
directly or indirectly.

Exception classes are meant to be kept simple, only offering a number of
attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers
for the exception. When creating a module that can raise several distinct
errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions defined by
that module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for
different error conditions:

```python
class Error(Exception):
    """Base class for exceptions in this module."""


class ConceptNotFoundError(Error):
    """Transactions with unmatched concept."""

    def __init__(self, message: str, transactions: List[Transaction]) -> None:
        """Initialize the exception."""
        self.message = message
        self.transactions = transactions
        super().__init__(self.message)
```

Most exceptions are defined with names that end in “Error”, similar to the
naming of the standard exceptions.

## [Import a module or it's objects from within a python program](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html)

```python
import importlib

module = importlib.import_module("os")
module_class = module.getcwd

relative_module = importlib.import_module(".model", package="mypackage")
class_to_extract = "MyModel"
extracted_class = geattr(relative_module, class_to_extract)
```

The first argument specifies what module to import in absolute or relative terms
(e.g. either `pkg.mod` or `..mod`). If the name is specified in relative terms,
then the package argument must be set to the name of the package which is to act
as the anchor for resolving the package name (e.g.
`import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')` will `import pkg.mod`).

# [Get system's timezone and use it in datetime](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61124241)
