[Cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking) as defined in Wikipedia, is the
art, science, and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. It sounds
like an enlightening experience that brings you joy. Reality then slaps you in
the face yet once again. It's very different to cook because you want to, than
cooking because you *need* to. I love to eat, but have always hated to cook,
mainly because I've always seen cooking with that second view.

Being something disgusting that I had to do, pushed me to batch cook once a week as
quickly as possible, and to buy prepared food from the local squat center's
tavern. Now I aim to shift my point of view to enjoy the time invested preparing
food. Two are the main reasons: I'm going to spend a great amount of my life
in front of the stove, so I'd better enjoy it, and probably the end result would
be better for my well being.

One way that can help me with the switch, is to understand the science behind it
and be precise with the process. Thus this section was born, I'll start with the
very basics and build from there on.
