Anti-transphobia being reductionist is the opposition to the collection of ideas
and phenomena that encompass a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions
towards transgender people or transness in general. Transphobia can include
fear, aversion, hatred, violence, anger, or discomfort felt or expressed towards
people who do not conform to social gender expectations. It is often expressed
alongside homophobic views and hence is often considered an aspect of
homophobia.

It's yet another clear case of privileged people oppressing even further
already oppressed collectives. We can clearly see it if we use the ever useful

# TERF

[TERF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF) is an acronym for *trans-exclusionary
radical feminist*. The term originally applied to the minority of feminists that
expressed transphobic sentiments such as the rejection of the assertion that
trans women are women, the exclusion of trans women from women's spaces, and
opposition to transgender rights legislation. The meaning has since expanded to
refer more broadly to people with trans-exclusionary views who may have no
involvement with radical feminism.

### Sex is a medical category and gender a social category

Sex is a medical category, it's not a biological one. According to body features
like the chromosome structure and genitalia appearance, medicine assigns the
sex (hence gender) to the bodies. In the case of intersexual people, they are
usually mutilated and hormonated so that their bodies fit into one of the two
options contemplated by the medicine.

Gender is the term we use to refer to how a person feels about themselves as
a boy/man, a girl/woman or non-binary.

Since birth, we're told what's appropriate (and what isn't) for each gender.
These are the gender roles. It's not the same gender than gender role: the
gender determines how you interact with the other roles. For example, a woman
can take traditionally understood male roles gender roles, that doesn't mean
that she is or isn't a woman.

The problem arises when these two oppressions are mixed up: cissexism (the
believe that bodies have an immutable gender defined by the sex assigned at
birth) and misogyny (the base of feminine oppression). When you mixing them up
you get the idea that the trans movement erases the feminine structural
oppression, when in reality, it broadens the scope and makes it more precise, as
they suffer the same misogyny than the cis women.

Women are killed for being women. They are socially assigned the responsibility
for care, they are prevented from having individual will and they are deterred
from accessing resources. This structural violence is suffered by all women
regardless of the sex assigned at birth.

Questioning the adjudication of gender to the bodies and questioning the
roles assigned to the genders are complementary paths for the feminism
liberation.

### Avoid the interested manipulation of the sexual or gender identity

The sexual or gender identity determines whether there is correspondence with
the gender assigned at birth. When there isn't, it concerns a trans person.

The sex and gender terms represent the same reality, being sex the medical term,
and gender the academic one. Equally transexual and transgender represent the
same reality, although these last have a pathologizing undertone, the term
*trans* is preferred.

### Avoid the fears of letting trans people be

Some are afraid that the trans women negatively affect the statistics of unemployment,
laboral inequality, feminization of the poverty and machist violence, and they
contradict the problems of the cis women.

Trans people usually have a greater unemployment rate (85% in Spain), so the
glass ceiling is not yet even a concern, and they are also greatly affected by
machist violence.

The [queer theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_theory) doesn't erase or
blur women as a political subject. Thinking that it risks the rights and
achievements earned through the feminist movement shows a complete
misunderstanding of the theory.

### Women are not an entity

Women are not an entity, they are a group of people that are placed below men in
the social scale, each with her own unique experience. The woman identity
belongs to any person that identifies herself with it.

The fight against discrimination and towards inclusion politics should be
mandatory for all society, and shouldn't be used against the trans people.
