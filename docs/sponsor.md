[Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com) is the only
[non-profit](https://en.liberapay.com/about/faq#differences) recurrent donations
platform. It's been the most recommended platform from the people I know from
the open-source, activist environment.

[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/) would be my next choice, as they don't do
commissions on the donations and they support more features (that I don't need
right now) than Liberapay.

Each of these platforms use different payment processors such as:

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [Paypal](https://paypal.com)

Usually Stripe takes less commissions than Paypal, also Paypal is known for
closing user accounts and keeping their money.

# Conclusion

If you just want something simple and don't mind the difficulties of doing one
time donations of Liberapay, go with it, it's also the most ethical. If you want
something more powerful, then Ko-fi is the best solution. You can even have
both.

Try to avoid Paypal and use Stripe for both platforms.
