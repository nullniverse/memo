Sometimes is good to stop, get into your cave and do an introspection on how is
your life going.

I like to do this exercise the last week of the year. Although I'd like to do it
at least twice a year.

This article is the checklist I follow to do my life review, it may seem a lot
to you or maybe very simple. You can take it as a base or maybe to get some
ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.

The process then has many phases:

- [Housekeeping](#housekeeping)
- [Analysis](#analysis)
- [Planning](#planning)

# Housekeeping

As they are time expensive, probably lot of time may have passed since your last
life review, it's a good time to do some housekeeping tasks to have a tidy
environment (and data!) before you start analyzing everything.

- Extract all your media (photos, videos, text) from all your devices (mobiles,
  laptops, servers) to your central archive. For the portable devices I use
  [`syncthing`](syncthing.md) to sync all the important data to the
  [NAS](nas.md), although it's usually untidy.
- Once it's extracted tidy them all. For example you could group the pictures
  and videos in a tree of directories (`trips`, `trips/2022-06-Glasgow`,
  `trips/2022-06-Glasgow/2022-06-10-hiking-trail-lakes`, ...). As this is an
  unpleasant task I've created `claspy` a command line tool that helps you
  categorize the files into their desired paths. Do the same for the documents,
  music, binaries... everything! until you have an empty mobile and empty
  `Downloads` directory.
- Update [your ledger](beancount.md) so that it reflects the reality.
- Update [your task manager](task_management.md) systems so that it reflects the
  latest state.
- Update [your digital garden](digital_garden.md) so that you don't have any
  uncommited changes.

# Analysis

To do it I gather all the information from my
[life logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog) sources and start thinking
of what do I want to change. It helps me to write a markdown document with the
insights gathered in this process.

## What you have learned

It's always interesting to look back and see what you've learned throughout the
year. I have these sources of data:

- [Digital garden](#digital-garden)
- [Anki](#anki)

### Digital garden

If you happen to have a [digital garden](digital_garden.md) you can look at your
git history to know what has changed since the last year. That's cumbersome and
ugly though, it's better to review
[your newsletters](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/newsletter/0_newsletter_index/),
although you may need to use something like
[`mkdocs-newsletter`](https://lyz-code.github.io/mkdocs-newsletter/).

While you skim through the newsletters you can add to the analysis report the
highlights of what you've learned.

You can also check
[your repository insights](git.md#get-interesting-stats-of-the-repo).

### Anki

I use [`anki`](anki.md) to record the knowledge that I need to have in my mind.
The program has a "Stats" tab where you can see your insights of the last years
to understand how are you learning. You can also go to the "Browse" tab to sort
the cards by created and get an idea of which ones have been the most used
decks.

## What you've read

Each time I finish a book I register it in a document with a rating and
optionally a review. When doing the review I check which ones I read, which ones
I liked more, what genres have been the most popular for me, which authors. With
these data I create an analysis of what seems promising to read in the future.

I also update the section of "what you've learnt" with the insights of these
books.

## Task review

Follow the
[review process of the task management article](task_workflows#year-review).

# Planning

## What to read

With the analysis of what I've read I research for new books and create an
ordered list per genre.
