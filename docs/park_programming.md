Park programming is as you may guess, programming in parks, something I'm trying
these days, let's see how it goes.

# How to park program

To get the best experience out of it I've seen that before you get out it's good to:

* Store music in a directory so you don't have to stream it online.
* [Find the best spots](#find-the-best-spots).
* [Find the best times](#find-the-best-times).
* Get out of your dark themed comfort zone and configure a light theme for the
    windows you're going to use.
* Put on sun screen!
* Bring enough water.
* Bring a small cushion for the ass, and maybe another for the back.
* Pee before going out.
* Go with someone. I haven't yet tried how comfortable is park pair programming
    though.

While you're at it:

* Teether the internet from the mobile.
* Use headphones, be respectful `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`.
* Sit well, with your back straight.

## Find the best spots

The best spots are the ones that meet the next criteria:

* Quiet places with few human transit.
* Green surrounding environment.
* Pleasant heat, sunlight and humidity.
* Correct seat height.
* Has laptop support.
* Seat with back support.
* Far from bugs.

So far the best spots I've found have been:

* Benches in parks.
* Chess desks.

Look out for different spots to fulfill the different scenarios in terms of amount of heat and
sunlight.

## Find the best times

The best times are the ones that maximize the best spots criteria so:

* Weekdays over weekend
* Early mornings and late afternoons on summer, middle day on spring and autumn.

# Benefits

By doing park programming you:

* Move your ass out of your lair.
* Get a sun bath
* Breath fresh open air.
* Get to smile at passing by dogs or enjoy seeing them play.
* See trees and nature.
* Get higher chances to interact with other humans.

# Inconveniences

* You'll probably don't be as comfortable as in your common development place.
