[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster
and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two
major parts:

* A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules,
    for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

* A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output
    highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also
highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing
support.
