I've enjoyed learning new languages since a long time ago, for the simple pleasure of it and expanding the 
horizon of possibilities. Despite its benefits:

> _The brain regions and networks involved in learning a language become stronger, adaptable, and quicker to respond, which can help improve other tasks, mental skills, and areas of life unrelated to direct communication or language learning._ - [Real Simple](https://www.realsimple.com/cognitive-benefits-of-learning-second-language-7109650#:~:text=The%20brain%20regions%20and%20networks,direct%20communication%20or%20language%20learning.)

The sheer benefit of clear communication and fostering ties with foreign communities is by itself well worth it!

I'll be very vague about learning languages here regarding the methods as each invididual would be capable of knowing itself and leveraging the best method that matches it's preferences. 

Nonethless, it would be very unfair to not pinpoint one of my (unknowingly) mentors, Stephen Krashen:
