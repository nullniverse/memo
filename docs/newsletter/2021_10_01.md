* New: [A fake company and five million recycled flyers.](antifascist_actions.md#a-fake-company-and-five-million-recycled-flyers)

    A group of artists belonging to the [Center for political
    beauty](https://politicalbeauty.com/) created a fake company [Flyerservice
    Hahn](https://www.flyerservice-hahn.de/) and convinced more than 80 regional
    sections of the far right party AfD to hire them to deliver their electoral
    propaganda.
    
    They gathered five million flyers, with a total weight of 72 tons. They justify
    that they wouldn't be able to lie to the people, so they did nothing in the
    broader sense of the word. They declared that they are the ["world wide leader in
    the non-delivery of nazi
    propaganda"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBVq-PtrpY). At the start of the
    electoral campaign, they went to the AfD stands, and they let their members to
    give them flyers the throw them to the closest bin. "It's something that any
    citizen can freely do, we have only industrialized the process".
    
    They've done a [crowdfunding](https://afd-muell.de/) to fund the legal process
    that may result.
