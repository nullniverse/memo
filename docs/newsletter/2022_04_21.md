# [Coding](vuetify.md)

* New: Introduce Cypress.

    [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a next generation front end testing tool
    built for the modern web.

* New: Introduce Vite.

    [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster
    and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two
    major parts:
    
    * A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules,
        for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    
    * A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output
        highly optimized static assets for production.
    
    Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also
    highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing
    support.

* New: Introduce Vitest.

    [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a blazing fast unit-test framework powered by
    Vite.

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Trim silences of sound files.](linux_snippets.md#trim-silences-of-sound-files)

    To trim all silence longer than 2 seconds down to only 2 seconds long.
    
    ```bash
    sox in.wav out6.wav silence -l 1 0.1 1% -1 2.0 1%
    ```
    
    Note that SoX does nothing to bits of silence shorter than 2 seconds.
    
    If you encounter the `sox FAIL formats: no handler for file extension 'mp3'`
