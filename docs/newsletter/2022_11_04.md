# Life Management

## Task Management

### [OpenProject](task_tools.md)

* New: Introduce OpenProject.

    [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) is an Open source project management
    software.
    
    The benefits over other [similar software
    are](task_tools.md#web-based-task-manager):
    
    * It's popular: More than 6.2k stars on github, 1.7k forks.
    * [It's development is active](https://github.com/opf/openproject/pulse): in the
        last week they've merged 44 merged pull requests by 16 people.
    * They use their own software to [track their bugs](https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/)
    * [Easy to install](https://github.com/opf/openproject-deploy)
    * Easy to use
    * The community version is flexible enough to adapt to different workflows.
    * [Good installation and operation's documentation](https://www.openproject.org/docs/installation-and-operations/).
    * Very good API documentation.
    * Supports LDAP
    
    The things I don't like are:
    
    * Data can be exported as XML or CSV but it doesn't export everything. You have
        access to the database though, so if you'd like a better extraction of the
        data you in theory can do a selective dump of whatever you need.
    * It doesn't yet have [tag support](https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/work_packages/32181/activity).
        You can meanwhile add the strings you would use as tags in the description,
        and then filter by text in description.
    * There is no demo instance where you can try it. It's easy though to launch
        a [Proof of Concept environment yourself](#proof-of-concept) if you already
        know `docker-compose`.
    * Even thought the [Community (free) version has many features](https://www.openproject.org/pricing/#features) the next aren't:
        * [Status boards](https://www.openproject.org/docs/user-guide/agile-boards/#status-board):
            you can't have Kanban boards that show the state of the issues as
            columns. You can make it yourself through a Basic board and with the
            columns as the name of the state. But when you transition an issue from
            state, you need to move the issue and change the property yourself. I've
            thought of creating a script that works with the API to do this
            automatically, maybe through the webhooks of the openproject, but it
            would make more sense to spend time on `pydo`.
        * [Version boards](https://www.openproject.org/docs/user-guide/agile-boards/#version-board):
            Useful to transition issues between sprints when you didn't finish them
            in time. Probably this is easily solved through bulk editing the issues.
        * [Custom actions](https://www.openproject.org/docs/system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/custom-actions/)
            looks super cool, but as this gives additional value compared with the
            competitors, I understand it's a paid feature.
        * [Display relations in the work package list](https://www.openproject.org/docs/user-guide/work-packages/work-package-relations-hierarchies/#display-relations-in-work-package-list-premium-feature):
            It would be useful to quickly see which tasks are blocked, by whom and
            why. Nothing critical though.
        * [Multiselect custom fields](https://www.openproject.org/docs/system-admin-guide/custom-fields/#create-a-multi-select-custom-field-premium-feature):
            You can only do single valued fields. Can't understand why this is
            a paid feature.
        * 2FA authentication is only an Enterprise feature.
        * [OpenID and SAML](https://www.openproject.org/docs/system-admin-guide/authentication/openid-providers/)
            are an enterprise feature.
    
    Also included:
    
    * [How to install it](openproject.md#installation)
    * [How to operate it](openproject.md#operation)
    * [Tips](openproject.md#tips)

* New: [Web based task manager.](task_tools.md#web-based-task-manager)

    Life happened and the development of [pydo](https://lyz-code.github.io/pydo) has
    fallen behind in my priority list. I've also reached a point where [simplest
    one](#the-simplest-task-manager) is no longer suitable for my workflow because:
    
    * I loose a lot of time in the reviews.
    * I loose a lot of time when doing the different plannings (year, trimester,
        month, week, day).
    * I find it hard to organize and refine the backlog.
    
    As `pydo` is not ready yet and I need a solution that works *today* better than
    the simplest task manager, I've done an analysis of the state of the art of
    [self-hosted applications](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#software-development---project-management)
    of all of them the two that were more promising were [Taiga](task_tools.md#taiga) and
    [OpenProject](task_tools.md#openproject).
    
    Finally I chose [OpenProject](openproject.md).

## Languages

### [Configure Docker to host the application](docker.md)

* New: [Attach a docker to many networks.](docker.md#attach-a-docker-to-many-networks)

    You can't do it through the `docker run` command, there you can only specify one
    network. However, you can attach a docker to a network with the command:
    
    ```bash
    docker network attach network-name docker-name
    ```

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [ferdium](ferdium.md)

* New: Introduce ferdium.

    [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org) is a desktop application to have all your
    services in one place. It's similar to Rambox, Franz or Ferdi only that it's
    maintained by the community and respects your privacy.

### [finnix](finnix.md)

* New: Introduce finnix.

    [Finnix](https://www.finnix.org/) is a live Linux distribution specialized in
    the recovery, maintenance, testing of systems.
