### [Ansible Snippets](ansible_snippets.md)

* New: [Stop running docker containers.](ansible_snippets.md#stop-running-docker-containers)

    ```yaml
    - name: Get running containers
      docker_host_info:
        containers: yes
      register: docker_info
    
    - name: Stop running containers
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: stopped
      loop: "{{ docker_info.containers | map(attribute='Id') | list }}"
    ```

* New: [Moving a file remotely.](ansible_snippets.md#moving-a-file-remotely)
* New: [Speed up the stat module.](ansible_snippets.md#speed-up-the-stat-module)

    The `stat` module calculates the checksum and the md5 of the file in order to
    get the required data. If you just want to check if the file exists use:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Verify swapfile status
      stat:
        path: "{{ common_swapfile_location }}"
        get_checksum: no
        get_md5: no
        get_mime: no
        get_attributes: no
      register: swap_status
      changed_when: not swap_status.stat.exists
    ```

### [goaccess](goaccess.md)

* New: Introduce goaccess.

    [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/) is a fast terminal-based log analyzer.
    
    Its core idea is to quickly analyze and view web server statistics in real time
    without needing to use your browser (great if you want to do a quick analysis of
    your access log via SSH, or if you simply love working in the terminal).
    
    While the terminal output is the default output, it has the capability to
    generate a complete, self-contained real-time HTML report (great for analytics,
    monitoring and data visualization), as well as a JSON, and CSV report.

### [Vim](vim.md)

* New: [Delete a file inside vim.](vim.md#delete-a-file-inside-vim)

    ```vim
    :call delete(expand('%')) | bdelete!
    ```
