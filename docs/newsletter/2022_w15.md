* New: [Create the Life Warnings seed.](projects.md#life-warnings)

    I've always tackled the pursuit of the peace of mind by improving in task
    management, for example trying to predict when I have to do something in order
    to avoid a nuisance. Maybe it's more interesting to monitor and visibilice the
    warnings that are affecting you.

* Reorganization: Merge Self host a routing web application seed with host my own map seedling.
