# [Introduction](index.md)

* New: Add the donation information.

# Coding

## Languages

### [PDM](pdm.md)

* New: Suggest to use pydeps.

    If you get lost in understanding your dependencies, you can try using
    [`pydeps`](https://github.com/thebjorn/pydeps) to get your head around it.

### [Libraries](python_gnupg.md)

* New: Introduce python gnupg.

    [python-gnupg](https://github.com/vsajip/python-gnupg) is a Python library to
    interact with `gpg` taking care of the internal details and allows its users to
    generate and manage keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and sign and verify
    messages.
    
    [Installation](https://github.com/vsajip/python-gnupg#installing-from-pypi):
    
    ```bash
    pip install python-gnupg
    ```
    
    [Usage](https://gnupg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#getting-started):
    
    ```python
    gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome="/path/to/home/directory")
    
    gpg.decrypt("path/to/file")
    
    public_keys = gpg.list_keys()
    private_keys = gpg.list_keys(True)
    

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Pad a string with spaces.](python_snippets.md#pad-a-string-with-spaces)

    ```python
    >>> name = 'John'
    >>> name.ljust(15)
    'John           '
    ```

* New: [Get hostname of the machine.](python_snippets.md#get-hostname-of-the-machine)

    Any of the next three options:
    
    ```python
    import os
    
    os.uname()[1]
    
    import platform
    
    platform.node()
    
    import socket
    
    socket.gethostname()
    ```

* New: [Get common elements of two lists.](python_snippets.md#get-common-elements-of-two-lists)

    ```python
    >>> a = ['a', 'b']
    >>> b = ['c', 'd', 'b']
    >>> set(a) & set(b)
    {'b'}
    ```

* New: [Recursively find files.](python_snippets.md#recursively-find-files)

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    
    for path in Path("src").rglob("*.c"):
        print(path.name)
    ```

### [Elasticsearch](python_elasticsearch.md)

* New: Introduce python elasticsearch library.

    [Python elasticsearch](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is
    the Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common
    ground for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries to
    be opinion-free and very extendable.
    
    [Installation](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation):
    
    ```bash
    pip install elasticsearch
    ```
    
    Usage:
    
    ```python
    from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
    
    client = Elasticsearch("http://localhost:9200")
    
    +client.indices.get(index="*")
    
    resp = client.search(index="test-index", query={"match_all": {}})
    documents = resp.body["hits"]["hits"]
    
    doc = {"partial_document": "value"}
    resp = client.update(index=INDEX, id=id_, doc=doc)
    ```

### [pythonping](pythonping.md)

* New: Introduce pythonping.

    [pythonping](https://github.com/alessandromaggio/pythonping) is simple way to
    ping in Python. With it, you can send ICMP Probes to remote devices like you
    would do from the terminal.
    
    Warning: Since using `pythonping` requires root permissions or granting
    `cap_net_raw` capability to the python interpreter, try to measure the latency
    to a server by other means such as using `requests`.

### [Selenium](selenium.md)

* New: [Disable loading of images.](selenium.md#disable-loading-of-images)

    You can pass `options` to the initialization of the chromedriver to tweak how
    does the browser behave. To get a list of the actual `prefs` you can go to
    `chrome://prefs-internals`, there you can get the code you need to tweak.
    
    ```python
    options = ChromeOptions()
    options.add_experimental_option(
        "prefs",
        {
            "profile.default_content_setting_values.images": 2,
        },
    )
    ```
    

### [Typer](typer.md)

* New: [Create a `--version` command.](typer.md#create-a---version-command-)

    You could use a callback to implement a `--version` CLI option.
    
    It would show the version of your CLI program and then it would terminate it.
    Even before any other CLI parameter is processed.
    
    ```python
    from typing import Optional
    
    import typer
    
    __version__ = "0.1.0"
    
    def version_callback(value: bool) -> None:
        """Print the version of the program."""
        if value:
            print(f"Awesome CLI Version: {__version__}")
            raise typer.Exit()
    
    def main(
        version: Optional[bool] = typer.Option(
            None, "--version", callback=version_callback, is_eager=True
        ),
    ) -> None:
        ...
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        typer.run(main)
    ```

* New: [Testing.](typer.md#testing)

    Testing is similar to [`click` testing](click.md#testing-click-applications),
    but you import the `CliRunner` directly from `typer`:
    
    ```python
    from typer.testing import CliRunner
    ```

## [Sponsor](sponsor.md)

* New: Introduce sponsorship analysis.

    It may arrive the moment in your life where
    [someone wants to sponsor you](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix/issues/185#issuecomment-1329276169).
    There are many sponsoring platforms you can use, each has their advantages and
    disadvantages.
    
    - Liberapay.
    - Ko-fi.
    - Buy me a coffee.
    - Github Sponsor.

    [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com) is the only
    [non-profit](https://en.liberapay.com/about/faq#differences) recurrent donations
    platform. It's been the most recommended platform from the people I know from
    the open-source, activist environment.
    
    [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/) would be my next choice, as they don't do
    commissions on the donations and they support more features (that I don't need
    right now) than Liberapay.
