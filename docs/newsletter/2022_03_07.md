## Python

### [Boto3](boto3.md)

* New: [List the files of a bucket.](boto3.md#list-the-files-of-a-bucket)

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Resolve the 409 error.](fastapi.md#resolve-the-409-error)

    Probably an exception was raised in the backend, use `pdb` to follow the trace
    and catch where it happened.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [How to Find Duplicates in a List in Python.](python_snippets.md#how-to-find-duplicates-in-a-list-in-python)

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 7]

    duplicates = [number for number in numbers if numbers.count(number) > 1]
    unique_duplicates = list(set(duplicates))

    ```

    If you want to count the number of occurrences of each duplicate, you can use:

    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 7]

    counts = dict(Counter(numbers))
    duplicates = {key:value for key, value in counts.items() if value > 1}

    ```

    To remove the duplicates use a combination of `list` and `set`:

    ```python
    unique = list(set(numbers))

    ```

* New: [How to decompress a gz file.](python_snippets.md#how-to-decompress-a-gz-file)

    ```python
    import gzip
    import shutil
    with gzip.open('file.txt.gz', 'rb') as f_in:
        with open('file.txt', 'wb') as f_out:
            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)
    ```

* New: [How to compress/decompress a tar file.](python_snippets.md#how-to-compress/decompress-a-tar-file)

    ```python
    def compress(tar_file, members):
        """
        Adds files (`members`) to a tar_file and compress it
        """
        tar = tarfile.open(tar_file, mode="w:gz")

        for member in members:
            tar.add(member)

        tar.close()

    def decompress(tar_file, path, members=None):
        """
        Extracts `tar_file` and puts the `members` to `path`.
        If members is None, all members on `tar_file` will be extracted.
        """
        tar = tarfile.open(tar_file, mode="r:gz")
        if members is None:
            members = tar.getmembers()
        for member in members:
            tar.extract(member, path=path)
        tar.close()
    ```

# DevOps

## Infrastructure Solutions

### [Krew](krew.md)

* New: Introduce krew.

    [Krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew) is a tool that makes it easy to
    use kubectl plugins. Krew helps you discover plugins, install and manage them on
    your machine. It is similar to tools like apt, dnf or brew.

### [Ksniff](ksniff.md)

* New: Introduce Ksniff.

    [Ksniff](https://github.com/eldadru/ksniff) is a Kubectl plugin to ease sniffing
    on kubernetes pods using tcpdump and wireshark.

### [Mizu](mizu.md)

* New: Introduce mizu.

    [Mizu](https://getmizu.io/) is an API Traffic Viewer for Kubernetes, think `TCPDump` and Chrome Dev
    Tools combined.


### [Debugging](kubernetes_debugging.md)

* New: How to debug kubernetes network traffic.

    Sometimes you need to monitor the network traffic that goes between pods to
    solve an issue. There are different ways to see it:

    * [Using Mizu](mizu.md)
    * [Running tcpdump against a running container](kubernetes_debugging.md#running-tcpdump-against-a-running-container)
    * [Using ksniff](ksniff.md)
    * [Using ephemeral debug containers](kubernetes_debugging.md#using-ephemeral-debug-containers)

    Of all the solutions, the cleaner and easier is to use [Mizu](mizu.md).

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* Correction: [Clean snap data.](linux_snippets.md#clean-snap-data)

    If you're using `snap` you can clean space by:

    * Reduce the number of versions kept of a package with `snap set system
        refresh.retain=2`
    * Remove the old versions with `clean_snap.sh`

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        #Removes old revisions of snaps
        #CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
        set -eu
        LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
            while read snapname revision; do
                snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
            done)
        ```

* Correction: [Clean journalctl data.](linux_snippets.md#clean-journalctl-data)

    * Check how much space it's using: `journalctl --disk-usage`
    * Rotate the logs: `journalctl --rotate`

    Then you have three ways to reduce the data:

    1. Clear journal log older than X days: `journalctl --vacuum-time=2d`
    1. Restrict logs to a certain size: `journalctl --vacuum-size=100M`
    1. Restrict number of log files: `journactl --vacuum-files=5`.

    The operations above will affect the logs you have right now, but it won't solve
    the problem in the future. To let `journalctl` know the space you want to use
    open the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and set the `SystemMaxUse` to the
    amount you want (for example `1000M` for a gigabyte). Once edited restart the
    service with `sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
