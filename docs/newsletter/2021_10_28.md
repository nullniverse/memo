### [Full screen applications](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md)

* New: [Testing full screen applications.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#testing)
* New: [Pass more than one key.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#pass-more-than-one-key)

    To map an action to two key presses use `kb.add('g', 'g')`.

* New: [Add note on how to debug the styles of the components.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#styles)

    Set the style to `bg:#dc322f` and it will be highlighted in red.
    

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [Exclude the `if TYPE_CHECKING` code from the coverage.](pytest.md#excluding-code-from-coverage)

    If you want [other code to be
    excluded](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/831), for example the
    statements inside the `if TYPE_CHECKING:` add to your `pyproject.toml`:
    
    ```toml
    [tool.coverage.report]
    exclude_lines = [
        # Have to re-enable the standard pragma
        'pragma: no cover',
    
        # Type checking can not be tested
        'if TYPE_CHECKING:',
    ]
    ```

## Infrastructure as Code

### [Helmfile](helmfile.md)

* Correction: Use environment name instead of get values.

    Instead of `.Environment.Name`, in theory you could have used `.Vars | get "environment"`, which could have prevented the variables and secrets of the default environment will need to be called `default_values.yaml`, and `default_secrets.yaml`, which is misleading. But you can't use `.Values` in the `helmfile.yaml` as it's not loaded when the file is parsed, and you get an error. A solution would be to [layer the helmfile state files](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/blob/8594944f6374454e6ddea61d04b201133798cd95/docs/writing-helmfile.md#layering-state-template-files) but I wasn't able to make it work.

* New: How to install a chart only in one environment.

    ```yaml
    environments:
      default:
      production:
    
    ---
    
    releases:
    - name: newrelic-agent
      installed: {{ eq .Environment.Name "production" | toYaml }}
      # snip
    ```

* New: Add note that templates can't be used inside the secrets.

    See [this issue](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/issues/126)

### [Helm Secrets](helm_secrets.md)

* Correction: Update the repository url.

    The last fork is dead, long live the [fork](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets)

* New: How to install the plugin.

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Kitty](kitty.md)

* New: Enable infinite scrollback history.

    To make the history scrollback infinite add the next lines:
    
    ```
    scrollback_lines -1
    scrollback_pager_history_size 0
    ```

* New: [Reasons to migrate from urxvt to kitty.](kitty.md#reasons-to-migrate-from-urxvt-to-kitty)

    * It doesn't fuck up your terminal colors.
    * You can use [peek](peek.md) to record your screen.
    * Easier to extend.

### [Peek](peek.md)

* Correction: Add note that it works with kitty.
