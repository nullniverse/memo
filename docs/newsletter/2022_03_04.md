### [Pydantic Factories](pydantic_factories.md)

* New: [Creating your custom factories.](pydantic_factories.md#creating-your-custom-factories)

    If your model has an attribute that is not supported by `pydantic-factories` and
    it depends on third party libraries, you can create your custom extension
    subclassing the `ModelFactory`, and overriding the `get_mock_value` method to
    add your logic.
    
    ```
    from pydantic_factories import ModelFactory
    
    class CustomFactory(ModelFactory[Any]):
        """Tweak the ModelFactory to add our custom mocks."""
    
        @classmethod
        def get_mock_value(cls, field_type: Any) -> Any:
            """Add our custom mock value."""
            if str(field_type) == "my_super_rare_datetime_field":
                return cls._get_faker().date_time_between()
    
            return super().get_mock_value(field_type)
    ```
    
    Where `cls._get_faker()` is a `faker` instance that you can use to build your
    returned value.

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Resolve the 422 error.](fastapi.md#resolve-the-422-error)

    You're probably passing the wrong arguments to the POST request, to solve it see
    the `text` attribute of the result. For example:
    
    ```python
    result = client.post(
        "/source/add",
        json={"body": body},
    )
    
    result.text
    ```
    
    The error is telling us that the required `url` parameter is missing.

### [WAF](aws_waf.md)

* New: How to extract information from AWS WAF.

    [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) is a web application firewall that helps
    protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that
    may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
    AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling
    you to create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack
    patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. You can also customize
    rules that filter out specific traffic patterns.
    
    In the article there are many queries you can do on it's data and
    a workflow to understand your traffic.

## [Aerial Silk](aerial_silk.md)

* New: Introduce Aerial Silk, some warmups and some figures.

    [Aerial Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_silk) is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a fabric. The fabric may be hung as two pieces, or a single piece, folded to make a loop, classified as hammock silks. Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, drop, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying. Some performers use dried or spray rosin on their hands and feet to increase the friction and grip on the fabric.
