* New: [Version Update Manager.](projects.md#version-update-manager)

    Keeping software updated is not easy because:
    
    * There are many technologies involved: package managers (apt, yum, pip, yarn,
        npm, ...), programming languages (python, java, ruby, ...), operative
        systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ...), deployment technologies (OS install, Docker,
        Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm), template software (cruft).
    * Each software maintainers use a different version system.
    * Even a small increase in a version may break everything.
    * Sometimes only the latest version is the supported version.
    * It's not easy to check if the update went well.
    * You not only need the desired package to be updated, but also it's
        dependencies.
    
    I'd like to find a solution that:
    
    * Gives an overall insight of the update status of a system.
    * Automates the update process.
    * Support both single system installation or aggregator of multiple systems.
