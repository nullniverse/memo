* New: [Explain how to rerun failed cronjobs.](kubernetes_jobs.md#rerunning-failed-jobs)

    If you have a job that has failed after the 6 default retries, it will show up
    in your monitorization forever, to fix it, you can manually trigger the job.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get job "your-job" -o json \
        | jq 'del(.spec.selector)' \
        | jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)' \
        | kubectl replace --force -f -
    ```
