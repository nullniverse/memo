### [PDM](pdm.md)

* Correction: [Solve circular dependencies by manual constraining.](pdm.md#solve-circular-dependencies)

    It also helps to run `pdm update` with the `-v` flag, that way you see which are
    the candidates that are rejected, and you can put the constrain you want. For
    example, I was seeing the next traceback:
    
    ```
    pdm.termui: Conflicts detected:
      pyflakes>=3.0.0 (from <Candidate autoflake 2.0.0 from https://pypi.org/simple/autoflake/>)
      pyflakes<2.5.0,>=2.4.0 (from <Candidate flake8 4.0.1 from unknown>)
    ```
    
    So I added a new dependency to pin it:
    
    ```
    [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]
    dependencies = [
        # Until flakeheaven supports flake8 5.x
        # https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven/issues/132
        "flake8>=4.0.1,<5.0.0",
        "pyflakes<2.5.0",
    ]
    ```
    
    If none of the above works, you can override them:
    
    ```
    [tool.pdm.overrides]
    "importlib-metadata" = ">=3.10"
    ```
    

### [Click](click.md)

* New: [File System Isolation.](click.md#file-system-isolation)

    For basic command line tools with file system operations, the
    `CliRunner.isolated_filesystem()` method is useful for setting the current
    working directory to a new, empty folder.
    
    ```python
    from click.testing import CliRunner
    from cat import cat
    
    def test_cat():
        runner = CliRunner()
        with runner.isolated_filesystem():
            with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Hello World!")
    
            result = runner.invoke(cat, ["hello.txt"])
            assert result.exit_code == 0
            assert result.output == "Hello World!\n"
    ```
    
    Pass `temp_dir` to control where the temporary directory is created. The
    directory will not be removed by Click in this case. This is useful to integrate
    with a framework like Pytest that manages temporary files.
    
    ```python
    def test_keep_dir(tmp_path):
        runner = CliRunner()
    
        with runner.isolated_filesystem(temp_dir=tmp_path) as td:
            ...
    ```

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Pathlib make parent directories if they don't exist.](python_snippets.md#pathlib-make-parent-directories-if-they-don't-exist)

    ```python
    pathlib.Path("/tmp/sub1/sub2").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    ```
    
    From the
    [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir):
    
    - If `parents` is `true`, any missing parents of this path are created as
      needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into
      account (mimicking the POSIX `mkdir -p` command).
    
    - If `parents` is `false` (the default), a missing parent raises
      `FileNotFoundError`.
    
    - If `exist_ok` is `false` (the default), `FileExistsError` is raised if the
      target directory already exists.
    
    - If `exist_ok` is `true`, `FileExistsError` exceptions will be ignored (same
      behavior as the POSIX `mkdir -p` command), but only if the last path component
      is not an existing non-directory file.

* New: [Pathlib touch a file.](python_snippets.md#pathlib-touch-a-file)

    Create a file at this given path.
    
    ```python
    pathlib.Path("/tmp/file.txt").touch(exist_ok=True)
    ```
    
    If the file already exists, the function succeeds if `exist_ok` is `true` (and
    its modification time is updated to the current time), otherwise
    `FileExistsError` is raised.
    
    If the parent directory doesn't exist you need to create it first.
    
    ```python
    global_conf_path = xdg_home / "autoimport" / "config.toml"
    global_conf_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True)
    global_conf_path.touch(exist_ok=True)
    ```
