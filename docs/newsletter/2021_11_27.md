### [Regicide](regicide.md)

* New: Introduce the awesome Regicide card game.

    [Regicide](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/) is a wonderful cooperative card game for 1 to 4 players. It's awesome how they've built such a rich game dynamic with a normal deck of cards. Even if you can play it with any deck, I suggest to buy [the deck they sell](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/buy-regicide) because their cards are magnificent and they deserve the money for their impressive game. Another thing I love about them is that even if you can't or don't want to pay for the game, they give the [rules for free](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/assets/RegicideRulesA4.pdf?v=2).
    
    If you don't like reading the rules directly from their pdf (although it's quite short), they explain them in [this video](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/regicide).
    
    I've loved the game so much, that I've created some variations of the
    rules to make each game more different and changeling.
