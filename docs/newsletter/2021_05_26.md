## [Task Management](task_management.md)

* Improvement: Add the benefits when you do task management well, and the side effects if you do it wrong.

### [Task Management Workflows](task_workflows.md)

* New: Introduce the main task management workflows.

    Task management can be done at different levels. All of them help you in
    different ways to reduce the mental load, each also gives you extra benefits
    that can't be gained by the others. Going from lowest to highest abstraction
    level we have:
    
    * Pomodoro.
    * Task plan.
    * Day plan.
    * Week plan.
    * Month plan.
    * Semester plan.
    
    In the commit I've detailed the [Pomodoro technique](task_workflows.md#pomodoro) and the [task](task_workflows.md#task-plan), [day](task_workflows.md#day-plan) and [week](task_workflows.md#week-plan) plans.

# Other

* Reorganization: Move the tasks tools from the task management article to their own.
