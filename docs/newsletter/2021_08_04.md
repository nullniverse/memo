## Writing

### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: [Explain the use of z or s in some words.](orthography.md#use-of-z-or-s-in-some-words)

    It looks like American english uses `z` while British uses `s`, some examples:
    
    * [Organizations vs organisation](https://writingexplained.org/organisation-vs-organization-difference).
    * [Authorization vs authorisation](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/282621/authorization-vs-authorisation-im-in-some-real-dilemma).
    * [Customized vs customised](https://grammarist.com/spelling/customise-customize/).
    
    Both forms are correct, so choose the one that suits your liking.
