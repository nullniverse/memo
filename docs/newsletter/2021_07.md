* New: Introduce Tahoe-LAFS.

    [Tahoe-LAFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe-LAFS) is a free and open,
    secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant, distributed data store and distributed
    file system.
    
    Tahoe-LAFS is a system that helps you to store files. You run a client program
    on your computer, which talks to one or more storage servers on other computers.
    When you tell your client to store a file, it will encrypt that file, encode it
    into multiple pieces, then spread those pieces out among multiple servers. The
    pieces are all encrypted and protected against modifications. Later, when you
    ask your client to retrieve the file, it will find the necessary pieces, make
    sure they havenâ€™t been corrupted, reassemble them, and decrypt the result.
