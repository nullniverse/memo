## [Mentoring](mentoring.md)

* New: Introduce the concept and guidelines of mentorship.

    [Mentoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship) is a process for the
    informal transmission of knowledge, social capital, and the psychosocial support
    perceived by the recipient as relevant to work, career, or professional
    development; mentoring entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and
    during a sustained period of time, between a person who is perceived to have
    greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience (the mentor) and a person who
    is perceived to have less (the apprentice).

# Coding

## [Learning to code](code_learning.md)

* New: Introduce guidelines to learn how to code.

    Learning to code is a never ending, rewarding, frustrating, enlightening task.
    In this article you can see what is the generic roadmap (in my personal opinion)
    of a developer. As each of us is different, probably a generic roadmap won't
    suit your needs perfectly, if you are new to coding, I suggest you find
    a [mentor](mentoring.md) so you can both tweak it to your case.

### [Frontend developer](frontend_learning.md)

* New: Introduce guidelines to learn how to become a frontend developer.

    This section is the particularization of the [Development learning article](code_learning.md) for a frontend developer, in particular a [Vue](vuejs.md) developer.
    
    A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. It's
    main responsibility is to create what the user sees.
    
    The basic languages for Front-End Development are [HTML](html.md),
    [CSS](css.md), and [JavaScript](javascript.md). Nowadays writing interfaces with
    only the basic languages makes no sense as there are other languages and
    frameworks that make better and quicker solutions. One of them is
    [Vue](vuejs.md), which is the one I learnt, so the whole document will be
    focused on this path, nevertheless there are others popular ones like:
    [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_bootstrap.asp),
    [React](react.md), [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) or
    [Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp).
    
    The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how
    a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.

## [Git](git.md)

* New: Introduce git and how to learn it.

    [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a software for tracking changes in
    any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers
    collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals
    include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
    (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
    

## [Park programming](park_programming.md)

* New: Introduce the park programming concept.

    Park programming is as you may guess, programming in parks. It includes
    guidelines on:
    
    * How to park program
    * Finding the best spots
    * Finding the best times
