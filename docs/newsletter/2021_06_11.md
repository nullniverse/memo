* New: [Introduce seedling self-hosted map project.](projects.md#self-hosted-map)

    I love maps, as well as traveling and hiking. This project aims to create a web
    interface that let's me interact with the data gathered throughout my life. I'd
    like to:
    
    * Browse the waypoints and routes that I've done.
    * Create routes and export the gpx.
    * Be able to search through the data
    * Plan trips
