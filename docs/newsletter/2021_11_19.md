## Python

### [asyncio](asyncio.md)

* New: [Limit concurrency.](asyncio.md#limit-concurrency)

    Use [`asyncio.Semaphore`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphores).
    
    ```python
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    ```

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Remove a substring from the end of a string.](python_snippets.md#remove-a-substring-from-the-end-of-a-string)

    On Python 3.9 and newer you can use the `removeprefix` and `removesuffix` methods to
    remove an entire substring from either side of the string:
    
    ```python
    url = 'abcdc.com'
    url.removesuffix('.com')    # Returns 'abcdc'
    url.removeprefix('abcdc.')  # Returns 'com'
    ```
    
    On Python 3.8 and older you can use `endswith` and slicing:
    
    ```python
    url = 'abcdc.com'
    if url.endswith('.com'):
        url = url[:-4]
    ```

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: [Field customization.](pydantic.md#field-customization)

    Optionally, the `Field` function can be used to provide extra information about
    the field and validations. Such as the `title`, `default`, `description`
    and many others

### [Tenacity](tenacity.md)

* New: Introduce the Tenacity python library.

    [Tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.
