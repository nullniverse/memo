# Life Management

## [Music Management](music_management.md)

* New: Introduce how I manage my music library.

### [MusicBrainz](musicbrainz.md)

* New: How to contribute to MusicBrainz.

    [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) is an open music encyclopedia that
    collects music metadata and makes it available to the public.
    
    MusicBrainz aims to be:
    
    * The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute and
        releasing the data under open licenses.
    * The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous
        form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have
        meaningful conversations about music.
    
    Like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz is maintained by a global community of users and we
    want everyone — including you — to [participate and contribute](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Contribute).
