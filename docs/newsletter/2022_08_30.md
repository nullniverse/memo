## [Sleep](sleep.md)

* New: [How your brain generates sleep.](sleep.md#how-your-brain-generates-sleep)

    Brainwave activity of REM sleep looks similar to the one you have when you're
    awake. They cycle (going up and down) at a fast frequency of thirty or forty
    times per second in an unreliable pattern. This behaviour is explained by the
    fact that different parts of your waking brain are processing different pieces
    of information at different moments in time and in different ways.

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: [Ignore a field when representing an object.](pydantic.md#ignore-a-field-when-representing-an-object)

    Use `repr=False`. This is useful for properties that don't return a value
    quickly, for example if you save an `sh` background process.
    
    ```python
    class Temp(BaseModel):
        foo: typing.Any
        boo: typing.Any = Field(..., repr=False)
    ```

### [sh](python_sh.md)

* New: [Avoid exception logging when killing a background process.](python_sh.md#avoid-exception-logging-when-killing-a-background-process)

    In order to catch this exception execute your process with `_bg_exec=False` and
    execute `p.wait()` if you want to handle the exception. Otherwise don't use the
    `p.wait()`.
    
    ```python
    p = sh.sleep(100, _bg=True, _bg_exc=False)
    try:
        p.kill()
        p.wait()
    except sh.SignalException_SIGKILL as err:
        print("foo")
    
    foo
    ```
