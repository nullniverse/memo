## Writing

### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: [Explain what collocations are and how to avoid the word very.](orthography.md#use-collocations)

    Collocation refers to a natural combination of words that are closely affiliated
    with each other. They make it easier to avoid overused or ambiguous words like
    "very", "nice", or "beautiful", by using a pair of words that fit the context
    better and that have a more precise meaning.
