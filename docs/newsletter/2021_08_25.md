* New: Introduce antifascism.

    Antifascism is a method of politics, a locus of individual and group
    self-indentification, it's a transnational movement that adapted preexisting
    socialist, anarchist, and communist currents to a sudden need to react to the
    fascist menace ([Mark p. 11](#references)). It's based on the idea that [any
    oppression form](#how-to-identify-fascism) can't be allowed, and should be
    actively fought with whatever means are necessary.
