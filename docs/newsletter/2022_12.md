# Life Management

## [Life review](life_review.md)

* New: How to review your life.

    Sometimes is good to stop, get into your cave and do an introspection on how is
    your life going.
    
    I like to do this exercise the last week of the year. Although I'd like to do it
    at least twice a year.
    
    This article is the checklist I follow to do my life review, it may seem a lot
    to you or maybe very simple. You can take it as a base or maybe to get some
    ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.
    
    The process then has many phases:
    
    - [Housekeeping](life_review.md#housekeeping)
    - [Analysis](life_review.md#analysis)
    - [Planning](life_review.md#planning)
    

# Coding

## Languages

### [Libraries](python_gnupg.md)

* New: Introduce python gnupg.

    [python-gnupg](https://github.com/vsajip/python-gnupg) is a Python library to
    interact with `gpg` taking care of the internal details and allows its users to
    generate and manage keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and sign and verify
    messages.
    
    [Installation](https://github.com/vsajip/python-gnupg#installing-from-pypi):
    
    ```bash
    pip install python-gnupg
    ```
    
    [Usage](https://gnupg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#getting-started):
    
    ```python
    gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome="/path/to/home/directory")
    
    gpg.decrypt("path/to/file")
    
    public_keys = gpg.list_keys()
    private_keys = gpg.list_keys(True)
    

* Correction: Use `decrypt_file` instead of `decrypt` for files.

    ```python
    gpg.decrypt_file("path/to/file")
    ```
    
    Note: You can't pass `Path` arguments to `decrypt_file`.
    

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* Correction: Remove warning that `pytest-random-order` can't be used with `pytest-xdist`.

    The issue was fixed

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Get common elements of two lists.](python_snippets.md#get-common-elements-of-two-lists)

    ```python
    >>> a = ['a', 'b']
    >>> b = ['c', 'd', 'b']
    >>> set(a) & set(b)
    {'b'}
    ```

* New: [Recursively find files.](python_snippets.md#recursively-find-files)

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    
    for path in Path("src").rglob("*.c"):
        print(path.name)
    ```

* New: [Print an exception using the logging module.](python_snippets.md#using-the-logging-module)

    Logging an exception can be done with the module-level function
    `logging.exception()` like so:
    
    ```python
    import logging
    
    try:
        1 / 0
    except BaseException:
        logging.exception("An exception was thrown!")
    ```
    
    ```
    ERROR:root:An exception was thrown!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ".../Desktop/test.py", line 4, in <module>
        1/0
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    ```
    
    Notes
    
    - The function `logging.exception()` should only be called from an exception
      handler.
    
    - The logging module should not be used inside a logging handler to avoid a
      `RecursionError`.
    
    It's also possible to log the exception with another log level but still show
    the exception details by using the keyword argument `exc_info=True`, like so:
    
    ```python
    logging.critical("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
    logging.error("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
    logging.warning("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
    logging.info("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
    logging.debug("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
    
    logging.log(level, "An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
    ```

* New: [Print an exception with the traceback module.](python_snippets.md#with-the-traceback-module)

    The `traceback` module provides methods for formatting and printing exceptions
    and their tracebacks, e.g. this would print exception like the default handler
    does:
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    try:
        1 / 0
    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
    ```
    
    ```python
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:\scripts\divide_by_zero.py", line 4, in <module>
        1/0
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    ```

### [Elasticsearch](python_elasticsearch.md)

* New: Introduce python elasticsearch library.

    [Python elasticsearch](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is
    the Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common
    ground for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries to
    be opinion-free and very extendable.
    
    [Installation](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation):
    
    ```bash
    pip install elasticsearch
    ```
    
    Usage:
    
    ```python
    from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
    
    client = Elasticsearch("http://localhost:9200")
    
    +client.indices.get(index="*")
    
    resp = client.search(index="test-index", query={"match_all": {}})
    documents = resp.body["hits"]["hits"]
    
    doc = {"partial_document": "value"}
    resp = client.update(index=INDEX, id=id_, doc=doc)
    ```

## [Git](git.md)

* New: [Revert a commit.](git.md#revert-a-commit)

    ```bash
    git revert commit_id
    ```

* New: [Get interesting stats of the repo.](git.md#get-interesting-stats-of-the-repo)

    [Number of commits of the last year per user](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31190474/how-to-count-git-commits-per-user-in-a-date-range):
    
    ```bash
    git shortlog -sne --since="31 Dec 2020" --before="31 Dec 2021"
    ```
    
    You can also use [`git-fame`](https://github.com/casperdcl/git-fame#usage) to
    extract a more detailed report:
    
    ```bash
    $: git-fame --since 1.year --cost hour --loc ins -w -M -C
    
    | Author          |   hrs |   loc |   coms |   fils |  distribution   |
    |:----------------|------:|------:|-------:|-------:|:----------------|
    | Lyz             |    10 | 28933 |    112 |    238 | 64.1/33.3/75.8  |
    | GitHub Action   |     2 | 16194 |    220 |     73 | 35.9/65.5/23.2  |
    | Alexander Gil   |     2 |     9 |      1 |      1 | 0.0/ 0.3/ 0.3   |
    | n0rt3y5ur       |     2 |     1 |      1 |      1 | 0.0/ 0.3/ 0.3   |
    | Guilherme Danno |     2 |     1 |      1 |      1 | 0.0/ 0.3/ 0.3   |
    | lyz-code        |     2 |     0 |      1 |      0 | 0.0/ 0.3/ 0.0   |
    ```
    
    You can use `pipx install git-fame` to install it.

# DevOps

## Hardware

### [CPU](cpu.md)

* New: [Installation tips for CPU.](cpu.md#installation)

    When installing an AM4 CPU in the motherboard, rotate the CPU so that the small
    arrow on one of the corners of the chip matches the arrow on the corner of the
    motherboard socket.

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Download TS streams.](linux_snippets.md#download-ts-streams)

    Some sites give stream content with small `.ts` files that you can't download
    directly. Instead open the developer tools, reload the page and search for
    a request with extension `.m3u8`, that gives you the playlist of all the chunks
    of `.ts` files. Once you have that url you can use `yt-dlp` to download it.
    

### [qBittorrent](qbittorrent.md)

* New: Introduce qBittorrent.

    [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) is [my chosen](torrents.md) client
    for [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent).
    
    Some interesting sections added:
    
    * [Migration from other client](qbittorrent.md#Migration-from-other-client)
    * [Python interaction](qbittorrent.md#Python-interaction)
    * [Monitorization](qbittorrent.md#Monitorization)
    * [Automatic operation](qbittorrent.md#Automatic-operation)

### [Torrents](torrents.md)

* New: Compare the different torrent clients.

    [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) is a communication
    protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P), which enables users to distribute
    data and electronic files over the Internet in a decentralized manner.
    
    Each of us seeks something different for a torrent client, thus there is a wide
    set of software, you just need to find the one that's best for you. In my case
    I'm searching for a client that:
    
    - Scales well for many torrents
    
    - Is robust
    
    - Is maintained
    
    - Is popular
    
    - Is supported by the private trackers: Some torrent clients are banned by the
      tracker because they don't report correctly to the tracker when
      canceling/finishing a torrent session. If you use them then a few MB may not
      be counted towards the stats near the end, and torrents may still be listed in
      your profile for some time after you have closed the client. Each tracker has
      their list of allowed clients. Make sure to check them.
    
      Also, clients in alpha or beta versions should be avoided.
    
    - Can be easily monitored
    
    - Has a Python library or an API to interact with
    
    - Has clear and enough logs
    
    - Has RSS support
    
    - Has a pleasant UI
    
    - Supports categories
    
    - Can unpack content once it's downloaded
    
    - No ads
    
    - Easy to use behind a VPN with IP leakage protection.
    
    - Easy to deploy
    
    I don't need other features such as:
    
    - Preview content
    - Search in the torrent client
    
    The winner has been [qBittorrent](qbittorrent.md)
    

## Android

### [GrapheneOS](grapheneos.md)

* New: [Installation.](grapheneos.md#installation)

    I was not able to follow the [web](https://grapheneos.org/install/web)
    instructions so I had to follow the [cli](https://grapheneos.org/install/cli)
    ones.
    
    Whenever I run a `fastboot` command it got stuck in `< waiting for devices >`,
    so I added the next rules on the `udev` configuration at
    `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules`
    
    ```
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="18d1", ATTR{idProduct}=="4ee7", MODE="0600", OWNER="myuser"
    ```
    
    The `idProduct` and `idVendor` were deduced from `lsusb`. Then after a restart
    everything worked fine.

## Writing

### [Forking this garden](forking_this_wiki.md)

* Correction: Update forking instructions.

    I recommend against forking the repository via Github. If you do that, you'll have all the history of my repository, which will make your repository more heavy than it should (as I have a lot of images), and it will make it hard for me to make pull requests to your digital garden.
    
    Furthermore, you'll always see a message in your repo similar to `This branch is 909 commits ahead, 1030 commits behind lyz-code:master. ` like you can see in [this fork](https://github.com/m0wer/memento). Also if you don't want to keep all the content I've made so far and want to start from scratch then the only thing that is useful for you is the skeleton I've made, and I don't need any attribution or credit for that :P.
    
    If on the other hand you do want to keep all my content, then wouldn't it be better to just make contributions to this repository instead?
    
    Therefore the best way to give credit and attribution is by building your garden (the more we are writing the merrier :) ), and then if you want to spread the word that my garden exists within your content then that would be awesome.
    
    If you end up building your own, remember to add yourself to the [digital
    garden's list](https://github.com/lyz-code/best-of-digital-gardens).

## Video Gaming

### [Age of Empires](age_of_empires.md)

* New: Introduce the Age of Empires videogame.

    * [How to do the basic opening](age_of_empires.md#basic-opening): What
      to do when to pass to the feudal age in 8 minutes 30 seconds
    * [How to micromanage](age_of_empires.md#Micromanagements) different
      processes such as sheep, deer, boar hunting, house building,
      lumberjacking

# Other

* New: Introduce the Alder tree.

    ![ ](Alder-3.jpg)
    
    Alders are trees comprising the genus Alnus in the birch family Betulaceae (like
    the [birch](#birch)). The genus parts are "al" which means "close by" and "lan"
    which means "side of the river", so they are trees that grow close to rivers or
    creeks.

* Correction: Give more details of the beech tree.

    ![ ](beech-4.jpg)
    The leaves of beech trees are elliptic, a little pointy at the end, flat, and
    with a short petiole. They are big and wide leaves ranging from 4-9 cm long.
    Very abundant, they have a light green colour with a darker tone and glossy on
    the upper side.
    
    The fruit is a small, sharply three-angled nut 10-15 mm long, borne singly or in
    pairs in soft-spined husks 1.5-2.5 cm long, known as cupules. The husk can have
    a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in
    addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated. The
    nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) with a
    high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.
    
    They are big trees easily going between 30 and 45 meters. It looks very
    different if its isolated or being part of a forest. The first one the branches
    grow from the middle of the trunk and are horizontal, in the second, the
    branches go up and start over the half of the trunk. The principal root is very
    powerful, with very strong secondary roots, developing lateral superficial
    roots.
    
    ![ ](beech-bark.jpg)
    
    The trunk is right with a grayish-cinder bark, smooth until it's old, usually
    covered by moss an lichen. Smaller branches are zigzagging with reddish-brown
    pointy buds.
    
    The canopy is big, dense, rounded and semi spheric, giving a lot of shadow.
    
    It grows slow in the first years, being the most active between the tenth and
    twelve year, reaching it's maximum height when it's twenty five, although it
    lives around three hundred years.

* Correction: Give more details of the birch tree.

    The simple leaves are rhomboidal, between 3 and 6 cm, singly or doubly serrate
    except at the base, feather-veined, petiolate and stipulate. Although they are
    alternate, many leaves spawn from each side of the branch, making some think
    that they are not alternate. They often appear in pairs, but these pairs are
    really borne on spur-like, two-leaved, lateral branchlets.
    
    The canopy is rounded and irregular giving few shadow.
    
    The fruit is a small samara, although the wings may be obscure in some species.
    They differ from the alders in that the female catkins are not woody and
    disintegrate at maturity, falling apart to release the seeds, unlike the woody,
    cone-like female alder catkins.
    
    The bark of all birches is characteristically smooth and white, although in
    older ones the lower part is usually cracked and takes blackish brown colours.
    It's marked with long, horizontal lenticels, and often separates into thin,
    papery plates, especially upon the paper birch.

* New: How to tell apart the different trees.
