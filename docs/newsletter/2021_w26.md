* New: [Explain how to use watchtower to keep docker containers updated.](docker.md#how-to-keep-containers-updated)

    With [watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) you can update the running
    version of your containerized app simply by pushing a new image to the Docker
    Hub or your own image registry. Watchtower will pull down your new image,
    gracefully shut down your existing container and restart it with the same
    options that were used when it was deployed initially.
    

* Correction: Explain how to run the watchtower checks immediately.

    With the `--run-once` flag
