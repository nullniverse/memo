### [Type Hints](docker.md)

* New: Suggest to use `Sequence` over `List`.

    Because using `List` could lead to some unexpected errors when combined with type inference. For example:
    
    ```python
    class A: ...
    class B(A): ...
    
    lst = [A(), A()]  # Inferred type is List[A]
    new_lst = [B(), B()]  # inferred type is List[B]
    lst = new_lst  # mypy will complain about this, because List is invariant
    ```
    
    Possible strategies in such situations are:
    
    * Use an explicit type annotation:
    
        ```python
        new_lst: List[A] = [B(), B()]
        lst = new_lst  # OK
        ```
    
    * Make a copy of the right hand side:
    
        ```python
        lst = list(new_lst) # Also OK
        ```
    
    * Use immutable collections as annotations whenever possible:
    
        ```python
        def f_bad(x: List[A]) -> A:
            return x[0]
        f_bad(new_lst) # Fails
    
        def f_good(x: Sequence[A]) -> A:
            return x[0]
        f_good(new_lst) # OK
        ```

* New: [Overloading the methods.](type_hints.md#overloading-the-methods)

    Sometimes the types of several variables are related, such as “if x is type A,
    y is type B, else y is type C”. Basic type hints cannot describe such
    relationships, making type checking cumbersome or inaccurate. We can instead use
    `@typing.overload` to represent type relationships properly.
    
    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations
    
    from collections.abc import Sequence
    from typing import overload
    
    @overload
    def double(input_: int) -> int:
        ...
    
    @overload
    def double(input_: Sequence[int]) -> list[int]:
        ...
    
    def double(input_: int | Sequence[int]) -> int | list[int]:
        if isinstance(input_, Sequence):
            return [i * 2 for i in input_]
        return input_ * 2
    ```
    
    This looks a bit weird at first glance—we are defining double three times! Let’s
    take it apart.
    
    The first two `@overload` definitions exist only for their type hints. Each
    definition represents an allowed combination of types. These definitions never
    run, so their bodies could contain anything, but it’s idiomatic to use Python’s
    `...` (ellipsis) literal.
    
    The third definition is the actual implementation. In this case, we need to
    provide type hints that union all the possible types for each variable. Without
    such hints, Mypy will skip type checking the function body.
    
    When Mypy checks the file, it collects the `@overload` definitions as type
    hints. It then uses the first non-`@overload` definition as the implementation.
    All `@overload` definitions must come before the implementation, and multiple
    implementations are not allowed.
    
    When Python imports the file, the `@overload` definitions create temporary
    double functions, but each is overridden by the next definition. After
    importing, only the implementation exists. As a protection against accidentally
    missing implementations, attempting to call an `@overload` definition will raise
    a `NotImplementedError`.
    
    `@overload` can represent arbitrarily complex scenarios. For a couple more examples, see the function overloading section of the [Mypy docs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/more_types.html#function-overloading).

    Use `journalctl -eu docker` to debug

## Automating Processes

### [cruft](cruft.md)

* New: [Unable to interpret changes between current project and cookiecutter template as unicode.](cruft.md#issues)

    Typically a result of hidden binary files in project folder. Maybe you have
    a hook that initializes the `.git` directory, don't do that.

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* Correction: [Clean old kernels warning.](linux_snippets.md#clean-old-kernels)

    I don't recommend using this step, rely on `apt-get autoremove`, it's safer.
    

### [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.md)

* New: [Convert VOB to mkv.](ffmpeg.md#convert-vob-to-mkv)

    * Unify your VOBs
        ```bash
        cat *.VOB > output.vob
        ```
    
    * Identify the streams
    
        ```bash
        ffmpeg -analyzeduration 100M -probesize 100M -i output.vob
        ```
    
        Select the streams that you are interested in, imagine that is 1, 3, 4,
        5 and 6.
    
    * Encoding
    
        ```bash
        ffmpeg \
          -analyzeduration 100M -probesize 100M \
          -i output.vob \
          -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -map 0:4 -map 0:5 -map 0:6 \
