# [Projects](projects.md)

* New: [Add seed to self host a routing web application.](projects.md#self-host-a-routing-web-application)

    Host and play around with [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and
    [brouter-web](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web).

# Life Management

## [Map Management](map_management.md)

* New: How I manage maps in my life.

    For navigating on the go, I strongly recommend [OSMand+](osmand.md), for
    browsing maps in the browser, use [OpenStreetMaps](https://osm.org) or
    [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org) if you want to move by bike.
    
    To plan routes, you can use [brouter.de](https://brouter.de/brouter-web), it works perfectly for bikes. For hiking is awesome too, it shows you a lot of data needed to plan your tracks (check the settings on the right). If you want to invest a little more time, you can even set your [personalize profiles](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki/Hiking-profiles), so that the routing algorithm prioritizes the routes to your desires. It's based on [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and both can be [self-hosted](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web), although [brouter does not yet use Docker](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter/issues/359).

# Coding

## Python

### [asyncio](asyncio.md)

* New: [Limit concurrency.](asyncio.md#limit-concurrency)

    Use [`asyncio.Semaphore`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphores).
    
    ```python
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    ```

### [Full screen applications](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md)

* New: [How to use Conditional Containers.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#conditional-containers)

    ```python
    from prompt_toolkit.layout import ConditionalContainer
    from prompt_toolkit.filters.utils import to_filter
    
    show_header = True
    ConditionalContainer(
        Label('This is an optional text'), filter=to_filter(show_header)
    )
    ```
    

### [Type Hints](type_hints.md)

* New: [Define a TypeVar with restrictions.](type_hints.md#define-a-typevar-with-restrictions)

    ```python
    from typing import TypeVar
    
    AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)
    ```

* New: [Use a constrained TypeVar in the definition of a class attributes.](type_hints.md#use-a-constrained-typevar-in-the-definition-of-a-class-attributes)

    If you try to use a `TypeVar` in the definition of a class attribute:
    
    ```python
    class File:
        """Model a computer file."""
    
        path: str
        content: Optional[AnyStr] = None # mypy error!
    ```
    
    [mypy](mypy.md) will complain with `Type variable AnyStr is unbound
    [valid-type]`, to solve it, you need to make the class inherit from the
    `Generic[AnyStr]`.
    
    ```python
    class File(Generic[AnyStr]):
        """Model a computer file."""
    
        path: str
        content: Optional[AnyStr] = None
    ```

### [Dash](dash.md)

* New: [Testing Dash applications.](dash.md#testing)

    `dash.testing` provides some off-the-rack pytest fixtures and a minimal set of
    testing APIs with our internal crafted best practices at the integration
    level. The commit includes a simple example and some guides on how to test Dash application.

### [Properties](factoryboy.md)

* New: [Automatically generate a factory from a pydantic model.](factoryboy.md#automatically-generate-a-factory-from-a-pydantic-model)

    Sadly [it's not yet supported](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/issues/869), [it will at some point though](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/issues/836). If you're interested in following this path, you can start with [mgaitan snippet](https://gist.github.com/mgaitan/dcbe08bf44a5af696f2af752624ac11b) for dataclasses.

* New: Give an overview on Python's @property decorator.

### [Faker](faker.md)

* New: [Create a random string with a defined format.](faker.md#create-a-random-string-with-a-defined-format)

    ```python
    faker.pystr_format("id-#######{{random_letter}}")
    'id-6443059M'
    ```

* New: [Create an IP address.](faker.md#create-an-ip-address)

    ```python
    faker.ipv4()
    ```
    
    If you want a CIDR, use `network=True`.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Replace all characters of a string with another character.](python_snippets.md#replace-all-characters-of-a-string-with-another-character)

    ```python
    mystring = '_'*len(mystring)
    ```

* New: [Make a flat list of lists with a list comprehension.](python_snippets.md#make-a-flat-list-of-lists-with-a-list-comprehension)

    There is no nice way to do it :(. The best I've found is:
    
    ```python
    t = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]]
    flat_list = [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]
    ```

* New: [Remove a substring from the end of a string.](python_snippets.md#remove-a-substring-from-the-end-of-a-string)

    On Python 3.9 and newer you can use the `removeprefix` and `removesuffix` methods to
    remove an entire substring from either side of the string:
    
    ```python
    url = 'abcdc.com'
    url.removesuffix('.com')    # Returns 'abcdc'
    url.removeprefix('abcdc.')  # Returns 'com'
    ```
    
    On Python 3.8 and older you can use `endswith` and slicing:
    
    ```python
    url = 'abcdc.com'
    if url.endswith('.com'):
        url = url[:-4]
    ```

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: [Define fields to exclude from exporting at config level.](pydantic.md#define-fields-to-exclude-from-exporting-at-config-level)

    Eagerly waiting for the release of the version 1.9 because you can [define the fields to exclude in the `Config` of the model](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/660) using something like:
    
    ```python
    class User(BaseModel):
        id: int
        username: str
        password: str
    
    class Transaction(BaseModel):
        id: str
        user: User
        value: int
    
        class Config:
            fields = {
                'value': {
                    'alias': 'Amount',
                    'exclude': ...,
                },
                'user': {
                    'exclude': {'username', 'password'}
                },
                'id': {
                    'dump_alias': 'external_id'
                }
            }
    ```
    
    The release it's taking its time because [the developer's gremlin and salaried work are sucking his time off](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/discussions/3228).

* New: [Field customization.](pydantic.md#field-customization)

    Optionally, the `Field` function can be used to provide extra information about
    the field and validations. Such as the `title`, `default`, `description`
    and many others

### [Tenacity](tenacity.md)

* New: Introduce the Tenacity python library.

    [Tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.

        --from=cronjobs/{{ cronjob_name}}
    ```

## Continuous Integration

### [Pyment](pyment.md)

* New: Introduce Pyment.

    [Pyment](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment) is a python3 program to
    automatically create, update or convert docstrings in existing Python files,
    managing several styles.
    
    As of 2021-11-17, the program is not production ready yet for me, I've tested it
    in one of my projects and found some bugs that needed to be fixed before it's
    usable. Despite the number of stars, it looks like the development pace has
    dropped dramatically, so it needs our help to get better :).

# Arts

## Board Gaming

### [Regicide](regicide.md)

* New: Introduce the awesome Regicide card game.

    [Regicide](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/) is a wonderful cooperative card game for 1 to 4 players. It's awesome how they've built such a rich game dynamic with a normal deck of cards. Even if you can play it with any deck, I suggest to buy [the deck they sell](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/buy-regicide) because their cards are magnificent and they deserve the money for their impressive game. Another thing I love about them is that even if you can't or don't want to pay for the game, they give the [rules for free](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/assets/RegicideRulesA4.pdf?v=2).
    
    If you don't like reading the rules directly from their pdf (although it's quite short), they explain them in [this video](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/regicide).
    
    I've loved the game so much, that I've created some variations of the
    rules to make each game more different and changeling.
