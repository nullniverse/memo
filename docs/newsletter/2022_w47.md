### [PDM](pdm.md)

* Correction: [Solve circular dependencies by manual constraining.](pdm.md#solve-circular-dependencies)

    It also helps to run `pdm update` with the `-v` flag, that way you see which are
    the candidates that are rejected, and you can put the constrain you want. For
    example, I was seeing the next traceback:
    
    ```
    pdm.termui: Conflicts detected:
      pyflakes>=3.0.0 (from <Candidate autoflake 2.0.0 from https://pypi.org/simple/autoflake/>)
      pyflakes<2.5.0,>=2.4.0 (from <Candidate flake8 4.0.1 from unknown>)
    ```
    
    So I added a new dependency to pin it:
    
    ```
    [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]
    dependencies = [
        # Until flakeheaven supports flake8 5.x
        # https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven/issues/132
        "flake8>=4.0.1,<5.0.0",
        "pyflakes<2.5.0",
    ]
    ```
    
    If none of the above works, you can override them:
    
    ```
    [tool.pdm.overrides]
    "importlib-metadata" = ">=3.10"
    ```
    

### [Click](click.md)

* New: [File System Isolation.](click.md#file-system-isolation)

    For basic command line tools with file system operations, the
    `CliRunner.isolated_filesystem()` method is useful for setting the current
    working directory to a new, empty folder.
    
    ```python
    from click.testing import CliRunner
    from cat import cat
    
    def test_cat():
        runner = CliRunner()
        with runner.isolated_filesystem():
            with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Hello World!")
    
            result = runner.invoke(cat, ["hello.txt"])
            assert result.exit_code == 0
            assert result.output == "Hello World!\n"
    ```
    
    Pass `temp_dir` to control where the temporary directory is created. The
    directory will not be removed by Click in this case. This is useful to integrate
    with a framework like Pytest that manages temporary files.
    
    ```python
    def test_keep_dir(tmp_path):
        runner = CliRunner()
    
        with runner.isolated_filesystem(temp_dir=tmp_path) as td:
            ...
    ```

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [The tmp_path fixture.](pytest.md#the-tmp_path-fixture)

    You can use the `tmp_path` fixture which will provide a temporary directory
    unique to the test invocation, created in the base temporary directory.
    
    `tmp_path` is a `pathlib.Path` object. Here is an example test usage:
    
    ```python
    def test_create_file(tmp_path):
        d = tmp_path / "sub"
        d.mkdir()
        p = d / "hello.txt"
        p.write_text(CONTENT)
        assert p.read_text() == CONTENT
        assert len(list(tmp_path.iterdir())) == 1
        assert 0
    ```

* Correction: [Deprecate the tmpdir fixture.](pytest.md#the-tmpdir-fixture)

    Warning: Don't use `tmpdir` use `tmp_path` instead because `tmpdir` uses `py`
    which is unmaintained and has unpatched vulnerabilities.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* Correction: Deprecate tmpdir in favour of tmp_path.
* New: [Pad integer with zeros.](python_snippets.md#pad-integer-with-zeros)

    ```python
    >>> length = 1
    >>> print(f'length = {length:03}')
    length = 001
    ```

* New: [Pathlib make parent directories if they don't exist.](python_snippets.md#pathlib-make-parent-directories-if-they-don't-exist)

    ```python
    pathlib.Path("/tmp/sub1/sub2").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    ```
    
    From the
    [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir):
    
    - If `parents` is `true`, any missing parents of this path are created as
      needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into
      account (mimicking the POSIX `mkdir -p` command).
    
    - If `parents` is `false` (the default), a missing parent raises
      `FileNotFoundError`.
    
    - If `exist_ok` is `false` (the default), `FileExistsError` is raised if the
      target directory already exists.
    
    - If `exist_ok` is `true`, `FileExistsError` exceptions will be ignored (same
      behavior as the POSIX `mkdir -p` command), but only if the last path component
      is not an existing non-directory file.

* New: [Pathlib touch a file.](python_snippets.md#pathlib-touch-a-file)

    Create a file at this given path.
    
    ```python
    pathlib.Path("/tmp/file.txt").touch(exist_ok=True)
    ```
    
    If the file already exists, the function succeeds if `exist_ok` is `true` (and
    its modification time is updated to the current time), otherwise
    `FileExistsError` is raised.
    
    If the parent directory doesn't exist you need to create it first.
    
    ```python
    global_conf_path = xdg_home / "autoimport" / "config.toml"
    global_conf_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True)
    global_conf_path.touch(exist_ok=True)
    ```

### [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md)

* New: [Get documents that match a string.](elasticsearch.md#get-documents-that-match-a-string)

    ```bash
    curl \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -XPOST "https://localhost:9200/_search" \
        -d' { "query": { "query_string": {"query": "test company"} }}'
    ```

# DevOps

## [Continuous Integration](mdformat.md)

* New: [Issues.](mdformat.md#issues)

    - It doesn't yet
      [support admonitions](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/309)
    - You can't
      [ignore some files](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/359),
      nor
      [some part of the file](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/53)
    

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Df and du showing different results.](linux_snippets.md#df-and-du-showing-different-results)

    Sometimes on a linux machine you will notice that both `df` command (display
    free disk space) and `du` command (display disk usage statistics) report
    different output. Usually, `df` will output a bigger disk usage than `du`.
    
    The `du` command estimates file space usage, and the `df` command shows file
    system disk space usage.
    
    There are many reasons why this could be happening:
    
    * [Disk mounted over data](linux_snippets.md#disk-mounted-over-data)
    * [Used deleted files](linux_snippets.md#used-deleted-files)

* New: [Clean up docker data.](linux_snippets.md#clean-up-docker-data)

    To remove unused `docker` data you can run `docker system prune -a`. This will
    remove:
    
    - All stopped containers
    - All networks not used by at least one container
    - All images without at least one container associated to them
    - All build cache
    
    Sometimes that's not enough, and your `/var/lib/docker` directory still weights
    more than it should. In those cases:
    
    - Stop the `docker` service.
    - Remove or move the data to another directory
    - Start the `docker` service.
    
    In order not to loose your persisted data, you need to configure your dockers to
    mount the data from a directory that's not within `/var/lib/docker`.

### [aleph](aleph.md)

* New: [Problems accessing redis locally.](aleph.md#problems-accessing-redis-locally)

    If you're with the VPN connected, turn it off.

* New: [PDB behaves weird.](aleph.md#pdb-behaves-weird)

    Sometimes you have two traces at the same time, so each time you run a PDB
    command it jumps from pdb trace. Quite confusing. Try to `c` the one you don't
    want so that you're left with the one you want. Or put the `pdb` trace in a
    conditional that only matches one of both threads.

# Other

* Correction: Update http versions to `HTTP/2.0`.

    It seems that the correct protocol is HTTP/2.0 now:
