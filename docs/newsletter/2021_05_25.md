## [Tool Management](tool_management.md)

* New: Introduce the tool management section.

    Most of the tasks or processes we do involve some kind of tool, the better you
    know how to use them, the better your efficiency will be. The more you use
    a tool, the more it's worth the investment of time to improve your usage of it.
    
    Whenever I use a tool, I try to think if I could configure it or use it in a way
    that will make it easier or quicker. Don't go crazy and try to change everything. Go
    step by step, and once you've internalized the improvement, implement the next.
