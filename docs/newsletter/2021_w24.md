* New: Introduce the prometheus elasticsearch exporter.

    The [elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter) allows
    monitoring [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md) clusters with [Prometheus](prometheus.md).
    
    Explain how to install it, configure the grafana dashboards and the
    alerts.
    

* Improvement: Add more elasticsearch alerts.

    Measure the search latency, search rate and create alerts on the garbage

### [dunst](dunst.md)

* New: Introduce dunst.

    [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) is a lightweight replacement for the
    notification daemons provided by most desktop environments. It’s very
    customizable, isn’t dependent on any toolkits, and therefore fits into those
    window manager centric setups we all love to customize to perfection.
