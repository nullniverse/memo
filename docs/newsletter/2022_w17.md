## [Mentoring](mentoring.md)

* New: Introduce the concept and guidelines of mentorship.

    [Mentoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship) is a process for the
    informal transmission of knowledge, social capital, and the psychosocial support
    perceived by the recipient as relevant to work, career, or professional
    development; mentoring entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and
    during a sustained period of time, between a person who is perceived to have
    greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience (the mentor) and a person who
    is perceived to have less (the apprentice).

# [Coding](vuejs.md)

* New: Add Cypress commands.

    For the functions you write a lot you can use commands in `/cypress/support/commands.ts`.
    
    ```javascript
    Cypress.Commands.add('getById', (selector, ...args) => {
      return cy.get(`[data-cy=${selector}]`, ...args)
    })
    
    Cypress.Commands.add('getByIdLike', (selector, ...args) => {
      return cy.get(`[data-cy*=${selector}]`, ...args)
    })
    
    Cypress.Commands.add('findById', {prevSubject: true}, (subject, selector, ...args) => {
      return subject.find(`[data-cy=${selector}]`, ...args)
    })
    ```
    
    So you can now do
    ```javascript
    cy.getById('submit')
    ```

* New: [Add more ways to select elements.](cypress.md#select-by-position-in-list)

    * Select by position in list
    
      Inside our list, we can select elements based on their position in the list,
      using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.eq()` selector.
    
      ```javascript
      cy
        .get('li')
        .first(); // select "red"
    
      cy
        .get('li')
        .last(); // select "violet"
    
      cy
        .get('li')
        .eq(2); // select "yellow"
      ```
    
      You can also use `.next()` and `.prev()` to navigate through the elements.
    
    *  Select elements by filtering
    
      Once you select multiple elements, you can filter within these based on another selector.
    
      ```javascript
      cy
        .get('li')
        .filter('.primary') // select all elements with the class .primary
      ```
    
      To do the exact opposite, you can use `.not()` command.
    
      ```javascript
      cy
        .get('li')
        .not('.primary') // select all elements without the class .primary
      ```

* New: [Finding elements.](cypress.md#finding-elements)

    You can specify your selector by first selecting an element you want to search
    within, and then look down the DOM structure to find a specific element you are
    looking for.
    
    ```javascript
    cy
      .get('.list')
      .find('.violet') // finds an element with class .violet inside .list element
    ```
    
    Instead of looking down the DOM structure and finding an element within another
    element, we can look up. In this example, we first select our list item, and
    then try to find an element with a `.list` class.
    
    ```javascript
    cy
      .get('.violet')
      .parent('.list') // finds an element with class .list that is above our .violet element
    ```

* New: [Assert on the content of an attribute.](cypress.md#asserting-about-elements)

    ```javascript
    cy
      .get('a')
      .invoke('attr', 'href')
      .should('eq', 'https://docs.cypress.io')
    ```

* New: [Use the content of a fixture set in a hook in a test.](cypress.md#use-the-content-of-a-fixture-set-in-a-hook-in-a-test)

    If you store and access the fixture data using this test context object, make
    sure to use `function () { ... }` callbacks both for the hook and the test.
    Otherwise the test engine will NOT have this pointing at the test context.
    
    ```javascript
    describe('User page', () => {
      beforeEach(function () {
        // "this" points at the test context object
        cy.fixture('user').then((user) => {
          // "this" is still the test context object
          this.user = user
        })
      })
    
      // the test callback is in "function () { ... }" form
     it('has user', function () {
        // this.user exists
        expect(this.user.firstName).to.equal('Jane')
      })
    })
    ```

* New: [Run only failing tests.](cypress.md#issues)

    Cypress doesn't [Allow to rerun failed tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4886) but you can use `it.only` on the test you want to run.

* New: [Make HTTP requests with Vue.](vuejs.md#make-http-requests)

    Compare [Fetch API](vuejs.md#fetch-api) and [Axios](vuejs.md#axios) when
    doing http requests to external services.
    
    Explain how to do them with both methods and arrive to the conclusion
    that if you’re working on multiple requests, you’ll find that Fetch requires you to
    write more code than Axios, even when taking into consideration the setup needed
    for it. Therefore, for simple requests, Fetch API and Axios are quite the same.
    However, for more complex requests, Axios is better as it allows you to
    configure multiple requests in one place.
    
    If you're making a simple request use the Fetch API, for the other cases use axios because:
    
    * It allows you to configure multiple requests in one place
    * Code is shorter.
    * It allows you to [place all the API calls under services so that these can be
        reused across components wherever they are
        needed](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-make-api-calls-in-vue-js-applications-43e017d4dc86).
    * It's easy to set a timeout of the request.
    * It supports HTTP interceptors by befault
    * It does automatic JSON data transformation.
    * It's supported by old browsers, although you can bypass the problem with fetch
        too.
    * It has a progress indicator for large files.
    * Supports simultaneous requests by default.
    
    Axios provides an easy-to-use API in a compact package for most of your HTTP
    communication needs. However, if you prefer to stick with native APIs, nothing
    stops you from implementing Axios features.

* New: [Simulate errors.](cypress.md#simulate-errors)

    ```javascript
    context('Errors', () => {
      const errorMsg = 'Oops! Try again later'
    
      it('simulates a server error', () => {
        cy.intercept(
          'GET',
          '**/search?query=cypress',

          .should('be.visible')
          .type('cypress{enter}')
        cy.wait('@getServerFailure')
    
        cy.contains(errorMsg)
          .should('be.visible')
      })
    
      it('simulates a network failure', () => {
        cy.intercept(

        cy.contais(errorMsg)
          .should('be.visible')
      })
    })
    ```

* New: [Handling errors doing requests to other endpoints.](vuejs.md#handling-errors)

    To catch errors when doing requests you could use:
    
    ```javascript
    try {
        let res = await axios.get('/my-api-route');
    
        // Work with the response...
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.response) {
            // The client was given an error response (5xx, 4xx)
            console.log(err.response.data);
            console.log(err.response.status);
            console.log(err.response.headers);
        } else if (error.request) {
            // The client never received a response, and the request was never left
            console.log(err.request);
        } else {
            // Anything else
            console.log('Error', err.message);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    The differences in the `error` object, indicate where the request encountered the issue.
    
    * `error.response`: If your `error` object has a `response` property, it means
        that your server returned a 4xx/5xx error. This will assist you choose what
        sort of message to return to users.
    
    * `error.request`: This error is caused by a network error, a hanging backend
        that does not respond instantly to each request, unauthorized or
        cross-domain requests, and lastly if the backend API returns an error.
    
        This occurs when the browser was able to initiate a request but did not
        receive a valid answer for any reason.
    
    * Other errors: It's possible that the `error` object does not have either
        a `response` or `request` object attached to it. In this case it is implied that
        there was an issue in setting up the request, which eventually triggered an
        error.
    
        For example, this could be the case if you omit the URL parameter from the
        `.get()` call, and thus no request was ever made.

* New: [Use Flexbox with Vuetify.](vuetify.md#flex)

    Control the layout of flex containers with alignment, justification and more
    with responsive flexbox utilities.
    
    !!! note
            "I suggest you use this page only as a reference, if it's the first time
            you see this content, it's better to see it at the
            [source](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/styles/flex) as you can see Flex in
            action at the same time you read, which makes it much more easy to
            understand."
    
    Explain how to use:
    
    * [Display breakpoints](vuetify.md#display-breakpoints).
    * [Flex direction](vuetify.md#flex-direction).
    * [Flex justify](vuetify.md#flex-justify).
    * [Flex align](vuetify.md#flex-align).
    * [Margins](vuetify.md#margins).
    * [Position elements with Flex](vuetify.md#position-elements-with-flex).
    * [Keep the structure even if some components are hidden](vuetify.md#Keep-the-structure-even-if-some-components-are-hidden).

* New: [Illustrations.](vuetify.md#illustrations)

    You can get nice illustrations for your web on [Drawkit](https://drawkit.com),
    for example I like to use the [Classic kit](https://drawkit.com/product/drawkit-classic).
    

* Correction: Correct the way to test for an attribute of an html element.

    ```javascript
    cy
     .get('a')
       .should('have.attr', 'href', 'https://docs.cypress.io')
       .and('have.attr', 'target', '_blank') // Test it's meant to be opened
       // another tab
    ```

* New: [Sending different responses.](cypress.md#sending-different-responses)

    To return different responses from a single `GET /todos` intercept, you can
    place all prepared responses into an array, and then use Array.prototype.shift
    to return and remove the first item.
    
    ```javascript
    it('returns list with more items on page reload', () => {
      const replies = [{ fixture: 'articles.json' }, { statusCode: 404 }]
      cy.intercept('GET', '/api/inbox', req => req.reply(replies.shift()))
    })
    ```

## [Learning to code](code_learning.md)

* New: Introduce guidelines to learn how to code.

    Learning to code is a never ending, rewarding, frustrating, enlightening task.
    In this article you can see what is the generic roadmap (in my personal opinion)
    of a developer. As each of us is different, probably a generic roadmap won't
    suit your needs perfectly, if you are new to coding, I suggest you find
    a [mentor](mentoring.md) so you can both tweak it to your case.

### [Frontend developer](frontend_learning.md)

* New: Introduce guidelines to learn how to become a frontend developer.

    This section is the particularization of the [Development learning article](code_learning.md) for a frontend developer, in particular a [Vue](vuejs.md) developer.
    
    A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. It's
    main responsibility is to create what the user sees.
    
    The basic languages for Front-End Development are [HTML](html.md),
    [CSS](css.md), and [JavaScript](javascript.md). Nowadays writing interfaces with
    only the basic languages makes no sense as there are other languages and
    frameworks that make better and quicker solutions. One of them is
    [Vue](vuejs.md), which is the one I learnt, so the whole document will be
    focused on this path, nevertheless there are others popular ones like:
    [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_bootstrap.asp),
    [React](react.md), [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) or
    [Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp).
    
    The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how
    a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.

## Python

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Get the attribute of an attribute when sorting.](python_snippets.md#get-the-attribute-of-an-attribute)

    To sort the list in place:
    
    ```python
    ut.sort(key=lambda x: x.count, reverse=True)
    ```
    
    To return a new list, use the `sorted()` built-in function:
    
    ```python
    newlist = sorted(ut, key=lambda x: x.body.id_, reverse=True)
    ```

## [Git](git.md)

* New: Introduce git and how to learn it.

    [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a software for tracking changes in
    any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers
    collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals
    include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
    (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
    

## [Park programming](park_programming.md)

* New: Introduce the park programming concept.

    Park programming is as you may guess, programming in parks. It includes
    guidelines on:
    
    * How to park program
    * Finding the best spots
    * Finding the best times
    

## Javascript

    const arr2 = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
    const children = arr1.concat(arr2);
    ```
    
    To join more arrays you can use:
    
    ```javascript
    const arr1 = ["Cecilie", "Lone"];
    const arr2 = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
    const arr3 = ["Robin"];
    const children = arr1.concat(arr2,arr3);

    if(typeof lastname !== "undefined")
    {
      alert("Hi. Variable is defined.");
    }
    ```
    feat(vue_snippets#Run function in background): Run function in background
    
    To achieve that you need to use [the javascript method called
    `setInterval()`](javascript.md#timing-events). It’s a simple function that would
    repeat the same task over and over again. Here’s an example:
    
    ```javascript
    function myFunction() {
    	setInterval(function(){ alert("Hello world"); }, 3000);
    }
    ```
    
    If you add a call to this method for any button and click on it, it will print
    Hello world every 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds) until you close the page.
    
    In Vue you could do something like:
    
    ```javascript
    
    <script>
    export default {
      data: () => ({
        inbox_retry: undefined
      }),
      methods: {
        retryGetInbox() {
          this.inbox_retry = setInterval(() => {
            if (this.showError) {
              console.log('Retrying the fetch of the inbox')
              // Add your code here.
            } else {
              clearInterval(this.inbox_retry)
            }
          }, 30000)
        }
      },
    ```
    
    You can call `this.retryGetInbox()` whenever you want to start running the
    function periodically. Once `this.showError` is `false`, we stop running the
    function with `clearInterval(this.inbox_retry)`.
