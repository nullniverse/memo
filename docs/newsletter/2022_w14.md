# [Projects](projects.md)

* Correction: [Deprecate faker-optional project.](projects.md#faker-optional)

    Wrapper over other Faker providers to return their value or `None`. Useful to
    create data of type `Optional[Any]`.
    
    Not needed anymore as I use [pydantic factories](pydantic_factories.md) now.
    

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Create Basic Auth header.](linux_snippets.md#create-basic-auth-header)

    ```bash
    $ echo -n user:password | base64
    dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
    ```
    
    Without the `-n` it won't work well.

* New: [Check vulnerabilities in Node.js applications.](linux_snippets.md#check-vulnerabilities-in-node.js-applications)

    With `yarn audit` you'll see the vulnerabilities, with `yarn outdated` you can
    see the packages that you need to update.

* New: [Check vulnerabilities in rails dependencies.](linux_snippets.md#check-vulnerabilities-in-rails-dependencies)

    ```bash
    gem install bundler-audit
    cd project_with_gem_lock
    bundler-audit
    ```
    

### [elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md)

* New: [Delete snapshot repository.](elasticsearch.md#delete-snapshot-repository)

    ```bash
    curl -XDELETE {{ url }}/_snapshot/{{ backup_path }}
    ```
