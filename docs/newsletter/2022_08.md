# [Projects](projects.md)

* New: [Version Update Manager.](projects.md#version-update-manager)

    Keeping software updated is not easy because:

    * There are many technologies involved: package managers (apt, yum, pip, yarn,
        npm, ...), programming languages (python, java, ruby, ...), operative
        systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ...), deployment technologies (OS install, Docker,
        Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm), template software (cruft).
    * Each software maintainers use a different version system.
    * Even a small increase in a version may break everything.
    * Sometimes only the latest version is the supported version.
    * It's not easy to check if the update went well.
    * You not only need the desired package to be updated, but also it's
        dependencies.

    I'd like to find a solution that:

    * Gives an overall insight of the update status of a system.
    * Automates the update process.
    * Support both single system installation or aggregator of multiple systems.


# Activism

## Antifascism

### [Antifascist Actions](antifascist_actions.md)

* New: [An open data initiative to map spanish fascist icons.](antifascist_actions.md#an-open-data-initiative-to-map-spanish-fascist-icons)

    The project [DeberíaDesaparecer](https://deberiadesaparecer.com) have created an
    open database of the remains of the spanish fascist regime icons. The
    visualization they've created is astonishing, and they've provided
    a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8jY6y0vcjQKNJBougQG_gTOUSfZGBhponOiwij9xVIwIafA/viewform?embedded=true)
    so that anyone can contribute to the dataset.

# Life Management

## Task Management

### [Task Management Workflows](task_workflows.md)

* Correction: Update the workflows.

    To suggest to use a script to follow them

# Health

## [Sleep](sleep.md)

* New: [How your brain generates sleep.](sleep.md#how-your-brain-generates-sleep)

    Brainwave activity of REM sleep looks similar to the one you have when you're
    awake. They cycle (going up and down) at a fast frequency of thirty or forty
    times per second in an unreliable pattern. This behaviour is explained by the
    fact that different parts of your waking brain are processing different pieces
    of information at different moments in time and in different ways.


# Coding

## [Learning to code](code_learning.md)

* New: [Suggest a workflow to learn Git.](code_learning.md#git)

    [Git](git.md) is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually
    used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source
    code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and
    support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches
    running on different systems).

    Git is a tough nut to crack, no matter how experience you are you'll frequently
    get surprised. Sadly it's one of the main tools to develop your code, so you
    must master it as soon as possible.

    I've listed you some resources
    [here](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/git/?h=git#learning-git) on how to
    start. From that article I think it's also interesting that you read about:

    * [Pull Request process](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/git/?h=git#pull-request-process)
    * [Git workflow](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/git/?h=git#git-workflow)

## Languages

### [Bash snippets](bash_snippets.md)

* New: [Do the remainder or modulus of a number.](bash_snippets.md#do-the-remainder-or-modulus-of-a-number)

    ```bash
    expr 5 % 3
    ```

* New: [Update a json file with jq.](bash_snippets.md#update-a-json-file-with-jq)

    Save the next snippet to a file, for example `jqr` and add it to your `$PATH`.

    ```bash

    query="$1"
    file=$2

    temp_file="$(mktemp)"

    jq "$query" $file > "$temp_file"

    cmp -s "$file" "$temp_file"
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]] ; then
      /bin/rm "$temp_file"
    else
      /bin/mv "$temp_file" "$file"
    fi
    ```

    Imagine you have the next json file:

    ```json
    {
      "property": true,
      "other_property": "value"
    }
    ```

    Then you can run:

    ```bash
    jqr '.property = false' status.json
    ```

    And then you'll have:

    ```json
    {
      "property": false,
      "other_property": "value"
    }
    ```

### [Dash](dash.md)

* Correction: Deprecate in favour of Streamlit.

    [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) is a much more easy, beautiful
    and clean library for the same purpose.

* New: [Running process in background.](python_sh.md#running-in-background)

    By default, each running command blocks until completion. If you have
    a long-running command, you can put it in the background with the `_bg=True`
    special kwarg:

    ```python
    sleep(3)
    print("...3 seconds later")

    p = sleep(3, _bg=True)
    print("prints immediately!")
    p.wait()
    print("...and 3 seconds later")
    ```

    You’ll notice that you need to call `RunningCommand.wait()` in order to exit
    after your command exits.

    Commands launched in the background ignore `SIGHUP`, meaning that when their
    controlling process (the session leader, if there is a controlling terminal)
    exits, they will not be signalled by the kernel. But because `sh` commands launch
    their processes in their own sessions by default, meaning they are their own
    session leaders, ignoring `SIGHUP` will normally have no impact. So the only time
    ignoring `SIGHUP` will do anything is if you use `_new_session=False`, in which case
    the controlling process will probably be the shell from which you launched
    python, and exiting that shell would normally send a `SIGHUP` to all child
    processes.

    If you want to terminate the process use `p.kill()`.

* New: [Output callbacks.](python_sh.md#output-callbacks)

    In combination with `_bg=True`, `sh` can use callbacks to process output
    incrementally by passing a callable function to `_out` and/or `_err`. This callable
    will be called for each line (or chunk) of data that your command outputs:

    ```python
    from sh import tail

    def process_output(line):
        print(line)

    p = tail("-f", "/var/log/some_log_file.log", _out=process_output, _bg=True)
    p.wait()
    ```

    To “quit” your callback, simply `return True`. This tells the command not to call
    your callback anymore. This does not kill the process though see [Interactive
    callbacks](#interactive-callbacks) for how to kill a process from a callback.

    The line or chunk received by the callback can either be of type str or bytes. If the output could be decoded using the provided encoding, a str will be passed to the callback, otherwise it would be raw bytes.

### [Qwik](qwik.md)

* New: Introduce Qwik.

    [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io) is a new kind of web framework that can deliver
    instantly load web applications at any size or complexity. Your sites and apps
    can boot with about 1kb of JS (regardless of application complexity), and
    achieve consistent performance at scale.

    You can see a good overview in the [Qwik
    presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dC11DMR3fU&t=154s).


### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: Change log level of a dependency.

    ```python
    caplog.set_level(logging.WARNING, logger="urllib3")
    ```

* New: [Show logging messages on the test run.](pytest.md#show-logging-messages-on-the-test-run)

    Add to your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
       log_cli = true
       log_cli_level = 10
    ```

    Or run it in the command itself `pytest -o log_cli=true --log-cli-level=10
    func.py`.

    Remember you can change the log level of the different components in case it's too verbose.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Initialize a dataclass with kwargs.](python_snippets.md#initialize-a-dataclass-with-kwargs)

    If you care about accessing attributes by name, or if you can't distinguish
    between known and unknown arguments during initialisation, then your last resort
    without rewriting `__init__` (which pretty much defeats the purpose of using
    dataclasses in the first place) is writing a `@classmethod`:

    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from inspect import signature

    @dataclass
    class Container:
        user_id: int
        body: str

        @classmethod
        def from_kwargs(cls, **kwargs):
            # fetch the constructor's signature
            cls_fields = {field for field in signature(cls).parameters}

            # split the kwargs into native ones and new ones
            native_args, new_args = {}, {}
            for key, value in kwargs.items():
                if key in cls_fields:
                    native_args[key] = value
                else:
                    new_args[key] = value

            # use the native ones to create the class ...
            ret = cls(**native_args)

            # ... and add the new ones by hand
            for new_key, new_value in new_args.items():
                setattr(ret, new_key, new_value)
            return ret
    ```

    Usage:

    ```python
    params = {'user_id': 1, 'body': 'foo', 'bar': 'baz', 'amount': 10}
    Container(**params)  # still doesn't work, raises a TypeError
    c = Container.from_kwargs(**params)
    print(c.bar)  # prints: 'baz'
    ```

* New: [Replace a substring of a string.](python_snippets.md#replace-a-substring-of-a-string)

    ```python
    txt = "I like bananas"

    x = txt.replace("bananas", "apples")
    ```

* New: [Create random number.](python_snippets.md#create-random-number)

    ```python
    import random
    a=random.randint(1,10)
    ```

* New: [Check if local port is available or in use.](python_snippets.md#check-if-local-port-is-available-or-in-use)

    Create a temporary socket and then try to bind to the port to see if it's
    available. Close the socket after validating that the port is available.

    ```python
    def port_in_use(port):
        """Test if a local port is used."""
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        with suppress(OSError):
            sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", port))
            return True
        sock.close()
        return False
    ```

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: [Ignore a field when representing an object.](pydantic.md#ignore-a-field-when-representing-an-object)

    Use `repr=False`. This is useful for properties that don't return a value
    quickly, for example if you save an `sh` background process.

    ```python
    class Temp(BaseModel):
        foo: typing.Any
        boo: typing.Any = Field(..., repr=False)
    ```

### [sh](python_sh.md)

* New: [Avoid exception logging when killing a background process.](python_sh.md#avoid-exception-logging-when-killing-a-background-process)

    In order to catch this exception execute your process with `_bg_exec=False` and
    execute `p.wait()` if you want to handle the exception. Otherwise don't use the
    `p.wait()`.

    ```python
    p = sh.sleep(100, _bg=True, _bg_exc=False)
    try:
        p.kill()
        p.wait()
    except sh.SignalException_SIGKILL as err:
        print("foo")

    foo
    ```

## [Git](git.md)

* Correction: [Update the git flow to match my current one.](git.md#)

# DevOps

## Infrastructure Solutions

### [Kubectl](kubectl.md)

* New: [Port forward / Tunnel to an internal service.](kubectl.md#port-forward-/-tunnel-to-an-internal-service)

    If you have a service running in kubernetes and you want to directly access it
    instead of going through the usual path, you can use `kubectl port-forward`.

    `kubectl port-forward` allows using resource name, such as a pod name, service
    replica set or deployment, to select the matching resource to port forward to.
    For example, the next commands are equivalent:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward mongo-75f59d57f4-4nd6q 28015:27017
    kubectl port-forward deployment/mongo 28015:27017
    kubectl port-forward replicaset/mongo-75f59d57f4 28015:27017
    kubectl port-forward service/mongo 28015:27017
    ```

    The output is similar to this:

    ```bash
    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:28015 -> 27017
    Forwarding from [::1]:28015 -> 27017
    ```

    If you don't need a specific local port, you can let `kubectl` choose and
    allocate the local port and thus relieve you from having to manage local port
    conflicts, with the slightly simpler syntax:

    ```bash
    $: kubectl port-forward deployment/mongo :27017

    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:63753 -> 27017
    Forwarding from [::1]:63753 -> 27017
    ```

* New: [Run a command against a specific context.](kubectl.md#run-a-command-against-a-specific-context)

    If you have multiple contexts and you want to be able to run commands against
    a context that you have access to but is not your active context you can use the
    `--context` global option for all `kubectl` commands:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --context <context_B>
    ```

    To get a list of available contexts use `kubectl config get-contexts`

## Monitoring

### [Prometheus](prometheus.md)

* New: [Accessing Prometheus metrics through python.](prometheus.md#accessing-prometheus-metrics-through-python)

    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.get(
        "http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/query",
        params={"query": "container_cpu_user_seconds_total"},
    )
    ```

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Scan a physical page in Linux.](linux_snippets.md#scan-a-physical-page-in-linux)

    Install `xsane` and run it.

### [Pipx](pipx.md)

* New: Introduce pipx.

    [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is a command line tool to install and run
    Python applications in isolated environments.

    Very useful not to pollute your user or device python environments.

    Install it with:

    ```bash
    pip install pipx
    ```


# Arts

## Cooking

### [Cooking software](cooking_software.md)

* New: Analysis of existing recipe manager software.

    List the expected features from the recipe manager and add links of the
    software found after an analysis of the state of the art, it's still
    a work in progress

# Other

* Reorganization: Reorder the programming languages under a Languages section.
* New: Bear with me or Bare with me.

    "Bear with me" is the correct form.
