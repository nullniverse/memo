# Life Management

## [News Management](news_management.md)

* New: Introduce news management.

    The information world of today is overwhelming. It can reach a point that you
    just want to disconnect so as to avoid the continuous bombardment, but that
    leads to loosing connection with what's happening in the world. Without knowing
    what's going on it's impossible to act to shape it better.
    
    I've started analyzing how to filter the content.

### [goaccess](goaccess.md)

* New: Introduce goaccess.

    [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/) is a fast terminal-based log analyzer.
    
    Its core idea is to quickly analyze and view web server statistics in real time
    without needing to use your browser (great if you want to do a quick analysis of
    your access log via SSH, or if you simply love working in the terminal).
    
    While the terminal output is the default output, it has the capability to
    generate a complete, self-contained real-time HTML report (great for analytics,
    monitoring and data visualization), as well as a JSON, and CSV report.

### [Profanity](profanity.md)
