## Infrastructure as Code

### [Terraform](terraform.md)

* New: Introduce terraform and how to handle RDS secrets.

    [Terraform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)) is an
    open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It
    enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using
    an awful high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language
    (HCL), or optionally JSON. Terraform supports a number of cloud
    infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services, IBM Cloud
    , Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, Linode, Microsoft Azure,
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OVH, or VMware vSphere as well as
    OpenNebula and OpenStack.

### [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)

* New: [Add Velero as interesting tool.](kubernetes.md#tools-to-test)

    [Velero](https://velero.io/) is a tool to backup and migrate Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes.

### [Architecture](kubernetes_architecture.md)

* New: [Give suggestions on how to choose the number of kubernetes clusters to use.](kubernetes_architecture.md#number-of-clusters)

    You can run a given set of workloads either on few large clusters (with many
    workloads in each cluster) or on many clusters (with few workloads in each
    cluster).
    
    Here's a table that summarizes the pros and cons of various approaches:

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Explain how to allocate space for a virtual filesystem.](linux_snippets.md#allocate-space-for-a-virtual-filesystem)

    ```bash
    fallocate -l 20G /path/to/file
    ```

## Writing

### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: [Explain the use of z or s in some words.](orthography.md#use-of-z-or-s-in-some-words)

    It looks like American english uses `z` while British uses `s`, some examples:
    
    * [Organizations vs organisation](https://writingexplained.org/organisation-vs-organization-difference).
    * [Authorization vs authorisation](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/282621/authorization-vs-authorisation-im-in-some-real-dilemma).
    * [Customized vs customised](https://grammarist.com/spelling/customise-customize/).
    
    Both forms are correct, so choose the one that suits your liking.
