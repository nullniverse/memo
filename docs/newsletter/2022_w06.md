    Add article [How to reduce online racism by Mark Holden](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/how-to-reduce-online-racism), a long essay with interesting tips and a lot of useful visualizations, I haven't checked the sources but it looks legit. (Thanks for the recommendation Laurie `:)`).

### [Github cli](gh.md)

* New: [Trigger a workflow run.](gh.md#trigger-a-workflow-run)

    To manually trigger a workflow you need to first configure it to allow
    [`workflow_dispatch`
    events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch).
    
    ```yaml
    on:
        workflow_dispatch:
    ```
    
    Then you can trigger the workflow with `gh workflow run {{ workflow_name }}`,
    where you can get the `workflow_name` with `gh workflow list`

### [Regicide](regicide.md)

* New: [Player modifiers extension.](regicide.md#player-modifiers)

    At the start of the game players can decide their suit, they will get a bonus on
    the played cards of their suit, and a penalization on the opposite suit. The
    opposite suits are:
    
    * ♠ opposite of ♥
    * ♣ opposite of ♦
    
    The bonus depends on the level of the enemy being:
    
    * J: +1 or -1
    * Q: +2 or -2
    * K: +3 or -3
