* New: [Introduce the shared accounting seed project.](projects.md#shared-accounting)

    I use [beancount](beancount.md) for my personal accounting, I'd like to have
    a system that integrates more less easily with beancount and let's do a shared
    accounting with other people, for example in trips. I've used [settle
    up](https://settleup.io/) in the past but it requires access to their servers,
    and an account linked to google, facebook or one you register in their servers.
    
    I've looked at [facto](https://github.com/nymanjens/facto) but it uses a logic
    that doesn't apply to my case, it does a heavy use on a common account, instead
    +of minimizing the transactions between the people. I also tried
    [tabby](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby#installation), even though they
    still [don't support Docker](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby/issues/13),
    but it doesn't suit my case either :(.
    
    Until a new solution shows up, I'll go with [Tricky
    Tripper](https://github.com/koelleChristian/trickytripper) available in F-Droid,
    and manage the expenses myself and periodically send the html reports to the
    rest of the group.

# Coding

## Python

### [asyncio](asyncio.md)

* New: Introduce the asyncio library.

    [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is a library to write
    concurrent code using the async/await syntax.
    
    asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that
    provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries,
    distributed task queues, etc.
    
    asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network
    code.

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* Improvement: Add link to the Awesome FastAPI page.

## [SQLite](sqlite.md)

* Improvement: Add rqlite as an interesting distributed solution of.

### [afew](afew.md)

* New: Introduce afew.

    [afew](https://github.com/afewmail/afew) is an [initial tagging
    script](http://notmuchmail.org/initial_tagging/) for [notmuch
    mail](notmuch.md).
    
    Its basic task is to provide automatic tagging each time new mail is registered
    with `notmuch`. In a classic setup, you might call it after `notmuch new` in an
    offlineimap post sync hook.

### [alot](alot.md)

* New: Introduce alot.

    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) is a terminal-based mail user agent based
    on the [notmuch mail indexer](notmuch.md). It is written in python using the
    urwid toolkit and features a modular and command prompt driven interface to
    provide a full MUA experience.
