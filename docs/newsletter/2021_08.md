* New: [Introduce pynbox the inbox management tool.](projects.md#pynbox)

    [Pynbox](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox) is a tool to improve the
    management of ideas, tasks, references, suggestions when I'm not in
    front of the computer. Right now I've got Markor for Android to register
    these quicknotes, but the reality is that I don't act upon them, so it's
    just a log of tasks that never get done, and ideas, references and
    suggestions that aren't registered in my knowledge or media management
    systems.
    
    On the computer there are also cases of tasks that are not worth registering in
    the task management system, or ideas that I get at a moment but don't have time
    to process at the moment.
    
    The idea then is to automatically sync the Android quicknote with syncthing,
    and have a special format for the file that allows [`pynbox`](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox)
    to extract
    the elements from that file to the "inbox system". For example:
    +
    ```
    t. buy groceries
    tv. IT crowd
    i. Improve the inbox management
    
    I want a system to improve ...
    ```
    
    Gets introduced in the "inbox system" as a task, a TV suggestion and an idea.

* New: Introduce nyxt as a solution for a better browser.

    I've just stumbled upon [nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/)
    ([code](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt)), and it looks superb.
    

* New: [Introduce the shared accounting seed project.](projects.md#shared-accounting)

    I use [beancount](beancount.md) for my personal accounting, I'd like to have
    a system that integrates more less easily with beancount and let's do a shared
    accounting with other people, for example in trips. I've used [settle
    up](https://settleup.io/) in the past but it requires access to their servers,
    and an account linked to google, facebook or one you register in their servers.
    
    I've looked at [facto](https://github.com/nymanjens/facto) but it uses a logic
    that doesn't apply to my case, it does a heavy use on a common account, instead
    +of minimizing the transactions between the people. I also tried
    [tabby](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby#installation), even though they
    still [don't support Docker](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby/issues/13),
    but it doesn't suit my case either :(.
    
    Until a new solution shows up, I'll go with [Tricky
    Tripper](https://github.com/koelleChristian/trickytripper) available in F-Droid,
    and manage the expenses myself and periodically send the html reports to the
    rest of the group.

* Improvement: Add quickwit as an interesting database solution for personal knowledge search engine.
* New: [Promote the automation of email management project to seedling.](projects.md#automate-email-management)

# [Activism](antitransphobia.md)

* New: Introduce Anti-transphobia.

    Anti-transphobia being reductionist is the opposition to the collection of ideas
    and phenomena that encompass a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions
    towards transgender people or transness in general. Transphobia can include
    fear, aversion, hatred, violence, anger, or discomfort felt or expressed towards
    people who do not conform to social gender expectations. It is often expressed
    alongside homophobic views and hence is often considered an aspect of
    homophobia.

* New: [Introduce arguments against terf ideology.](antitransphobia.md#terf)

    [TERF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF) is an acronym for *trans-exclusionary
    radical feminist*. The term originally applied to the minority of feminists that
    expressed transphobic sentiments such as the rejection of the assertion that
    trans women are women, the exclusion of trans women from women's spaces, and
    opposition to transgender rights legislation. The meaning has since expanded to
    refer more broadly to people with trans-exclusionary views who may have no
    involvement with radical feminism.
    

## [Antifascism](antifascism.md)

* New: Introduce antifascism.

    Antifascism is a method of politics, a locus of individual and group
    self-indentification, it's a transnational movement that adapted preexisting
    socialist, anarchist, and communist currents to a sudden need to react to the
    fascist menace ([Mark p. 11](#references)). It's based on the idea that [any
    oppression form](#how-to-identify-fascism) can't be allowed, and should be
    actively fought with whatever means are necessary.

### [asyncio](asyncio.md)

* New: Introduce the asyncio library.

    [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is a library to write
    concurrent code using the async/await syntax.
    
    asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that
    provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries,
    distributed task queues, etc.
    
    asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network
    code.
