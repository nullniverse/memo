# [Introduction](index.md)

* New: Simplify the landing page text.
* Reorganization: Merge the Meta article into the index.

# [Projects](projects.md)

* Improvement: [Add mkdocs-newsletter as a dormant plant.](projects.md#mkdocs-newsletter)

    MkDocs plugin to show the changes of documentation repositories in
    a user friendly format, at the same time that it's easy for the authors
    to maintain.

    It creates daily, weekly, monthly and yearly newsletter articles with
    the changes of each period. Those pages, stored under the `Newsletters`
    section, are filled with the changes extracted from the commit messages
    of the git history.  The changes are grouped by categories,
    subcategories and then by file using the order of the site's navigation
    structure. RSS feeds are also created for each newsletter type, so it's
    easy for people to keep updated with the evolution of the site.

* Reorganization: Update and reorganize projects.

    Following the [digital garden](digital_garden.md) metaphor


* Reorganization: [Merge the wish_list article into the projects.](projects.md#seeds)
* New: Add seed to follow the updates of software.
* New: Add seed to automatically update the dockers of maintained services.
* Improvement: Explain the updates on the repository-orm project.

    In the latest version `0.2.0`, we added:

    * Support for the [TinyDB repository](https://lyz-code.github.io/repository-orm/tinydb_repository/).
    * Support for regular expressions in the `search` method.
    * Easier repository loading with `load_repository` function.

* Improvement: Add a link to the meilisearch [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).
* New: Create the quantified self project.

    With links to the two starting points [HPI](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) and [bionic](https://github.com/bionic-dev/bionic).


* New: [Sketch how to automate repetitive tasks prompted by email events.](projects.md#automate-email-management)

    Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated,
    I've stumbled upon [notmuchmail](https://notmuchmail.org/), which looks very
    promising. A friend suggested to use
    [afew](https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tagging, and I'd probably use
    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) to interact with the system (and finally be
    able to use email from the cli).

* Improvement: [Add interesting interface.](projects.md#quantified-self)

    For the interface [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks awesome!
    It's inspired in the Andrew Louis [talk Building
    a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s) whose [blog
    posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seems to be a gold mine.

    Also look at [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi).

* New: [Sketch how to improve the launching of applications with i3wm.](projects.md#improve-the-way-of-launching-applications-with-i3wm)

    In the past I tried installing [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
    without success, I should try again. If the default features are not enough,
    check [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

* Improvement: [Show the changes of repository-orm 0.3.1.](projects.md#repository-orm)

    +* Add `first` and `last` methods to the repositories.
    +* Make entity `id_` definition optional.
    +* add `_model_name` attribute to entities.

* Improvement: [Add woop awesome quantified self resources to the research list.](projects.md#quantified-self)
* New: [Add project to migrate software bug tracker to a vendor free one like `git-bug`.](projects.md#migrate-software-bug-tracker-to-a-vendor-free-one)
* New: [Improve the notification management in Linux.](projects.md#improve-the-notification-management-in-linux)

    Create new seed project to be able to group and silence the notifications under a custom logic.
    For example:

    * If I want to focus on a task, only show the most important ones.
    * Only show alerts once every X minutes. Or define that I want to receive them
        the first 10 minutes of every hour.
    * If I'm not working, silence all work alerts.

* New: [Improve the hard drive monitor system.](projects.md#improve-the-hard-drive-monitor-system)

    Create new seed project to use something like [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) (there's a [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-scrutiny)) to collect and display the information. For alerts, use one of their [supported providers](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny#notifications).

* New: [Aggregate all notifications.](projects.md#aggregate-all-notifications)

    Instead of reading the email, github, gitlab, discourse, reddit notifications,
    aggregate all in one place and show them to the user in a nice command line
    interface.

    For the aggregator server, my first choice would be [gotify](https://gotify.net/).

* New: [Add faker-optional to the dormant plant projects.](projects.md#faker-optional)
* New: [Add seedling project to create factoryboy factories from pydantic models automatically.](projects.md#other)
* New: [Explain the idea of how to improve the record of ideas, tasks,.](projects.md#inbox-management)
* New: Add git-bug as an interesting distributed issue tracker.
* New: [Add the Improve the reliability of the Open Science collections project.](projects.md#improve-the-reliability-of-the-open-science-collections)

    The current [free knowledge efforts](free_knowledge.md): are based on the health
    of a collection of torrents. This project aims to create a command line
    tool or service that makes it easier to automate the seeding of ill
    torrents.

* New: [Add the Monitor and notify on disk prices project.](projects.md#monitor-and-notify-on-disk-prices)

    [Diskprices.com](https://diskprices.com/) sorts the prices of the disks on the
    different amazon sites based on many filters. It will be interesting to have
    a service that monitors the data on this site and alerts the user once there is
    a deal that matches its criteria.


* Reorganization: [Move the automation of computer file management project to the projects page.](projects.md#automating-computer-file-management)
* Reorganization: Move the dying projects below the seeds as they are less important.
* New: [Introduce seedling self-hosted map project.](projects.md#self-hosted-map)

    I love maps, as well as traveling and hiking. This project aims to create a web
    interface that let's me interact with the data gathered throughout my life. I'd
    like to:

    * Browse the waypoints and routes that I've done.
    * Create routes and export the gpx.
    * Be able to search through the data
    * Plan trips

* New: [Introduce the seed project to.](projects.md#switch-to-a-better-browser)
* New: [Add the Life seedling project.](projects.md#life)

    Life is a real time sandbox role game where you play as yourself surviving in today's
    world.


* New: [Add bruty to the dormant plant projects.](projects.md#bruty)

    [bruty](https://github.com/lyz-code/bruty) is a Python program to bruteforce dynamic web applications with Selenium.

* Improvement: Add rsarai hq to interesting sources for lifelogging.
* New: [Introduce pynbox the inbox management tool.](projects.md#pynbox)

    [Pynbox](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox) is a tool to improve the
    management of ideas, tasks, references, suggestions when I'm not in
    front of the computer. Right now I've got Markor for Android to register
    these quicknotes, but the reality is that I don't act upon them, so it's
    just a log of tasks that never get done, and ideas, references and
    suggestions that aren't registered in my knowledge or media management
    systems.

    On the computer there are also cases of tasks that are not worth registering in
    the task management system, or ideas that I get at a moment but don't have time
    to process at the moment.

    The idea then is to automatically sync the Android quicknote with syncthing,
    and have a special format for the file that allows [`pynbox`](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox)
    to extract
    the elements from that file to the "inbox system". For example:
    +
    ```
    t. buy groceries
    tv. IT crowd
    i. Improve the inbox management

    I want a system to improve ...
    ```

    Gets introduced in the "inbox system" as a task, a TV suggestion and an idea.

* New: Introduce nyxt as a solution for a better browser.

    I've just stumbled upon [nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/)
    ([code](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt)), and it looks superb.


* New: [Introduce the shared accounting seed project.](projects.md#shared-accounting)

    I use [beancount](beancount.md) for my personal accounting, I'd like to have
    a system that integrates more less easily with beancount and let's do a shared
    accounting with other people, for example in trips. I've used [settle
    up](https://settleup.io/) in the past but it requires access to their servers,
    and an account linked to google, facebook or one you register in their servers.

    I've looked at [facto](https://github.com/nymanjens/facto) but it uses a logic
    that doesn't apply to my case, it does a heavy use on a common account, instead
    +of minimizing the transactions between the people. I also tried
    [tabby](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby#installation), even though they
    still [don't support Docker](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby/issues/13),
    but it doesn't suit my case either :(.

    Until a new solution shows up, I'll go with [Tricky
    Tripper](https://github.com/koelleChristian/trickytripper) available in F-Droid,
    and manage the expenses myself and periodically send the html reports to the
    rest of the group.

* Improvement: Add quickwit as an interesting database solution for personal knowledge search engine.
* New: [Promote the automation of email management project to seedling.](projects.md#automate-email-management)
* New: [Introduce the pomodoro command line seed project.](projects.md#pomodoro-command-line)

    Command line to help with the [pomodoro workflow](task_workflows.md#pomodoro), besides the basic stuff it will interact with the task manager, [activitywatch](activitywatch.md) and the notifications system.

* New: [Introduce the ordered list of digital gardens project.](projects.md#create-an-ordered-list-of-digital-gardens)

    Use [best-of-lists](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of) to create an
    awesome list of digital gardens.

* Correction: Clean up deprecated projects.
* New: [Add seed to self host a routing web application.](projects.md#self-host-a-routing-web-application)

    Host and play around with [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and
    [brouter-web](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web).

# [Activism](anonymous_feedback.md)

* New: Introduce the anonymous feedback tool to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in an organization.

    Anonymous Feedback is a communication tool where people share feedback to
    teammates or other organizational members while protecting their identities.

    Until the safe space is built where direct feedback is viable, anonymous
    feedback gives these employees a mechanism to raise their concerns, practice their
    feedback-giving skills, test the waters, and understand how people perceive
    their constructive (and sometimes critical) opinions, thus building the needed
    trust.

* New: Define Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

    * *Diversity* is the representation and acknowledgement of the multitudes of
        identities, experiences, and ways of moving through the world. This
        includes—but is not limited to—ability, age, citizenship status, criminal
        record and/or incarceration, educational attainment, ethnicity, gender,
        geographical location, language, nationality, political affiliation,
        religion, race, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.
        Further, we recognize that each individual's experience is informed by
        intersections across multiple identities.

    * *Equity*  seeks to ensure respect and equal opportunity for all, using all
        resources and tools to elevate the voices of under-represented and/or
        disadvantaged groups.

    * *Inclusion* is fostering an environment in which people of all identities are
        welcome, valued, and supported. An inclusive organization solicits, listens
        to, learns from, and acts on the contributions of all its stakeholders.


* New: Introduce Anti-transphobia.

    Anti-transphobia being reductionist is the opposition to the collection of ideas
    and phenomena that encompass a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions
    towards transgender people or transness in general. Transphobia can include
    fear, aversion, hatred, violence, anger, or discomfort felt or expressed towards
    people who do not conform to social gender expectations. It is often expressed
    alongside homophobic views and hence is often considered an aspect of
    homophobia.

* New: [Introduce arguments against terf ideology.](antitransphobia.md#terf)

    [TERF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF) is an acronym for *trans-exclusionary
    radical feminist*. The term originally applied to the minority of feminists that
    expressed transphobic sentiments such as the rejection of the assertion that
    trans women are women, the exclusion of trans women from women's spaces, and
    opposition to transgender rights legislation. The meaning has since expanded to
    refer more broadly to people with trans-exclusionary views who may have no
    involvement with radical feminism.


## [Antifascism](antifascism.md)

* New: Introduce antifascism.

    Antifascism is a method of politics, a locus of individual and group
    self-indentification, it's a transnational movement that adapted preexisting
    socialist, anarchist, and communist currents to a sudden need to react to the
    fascist menace ([Mark p. 11](#references)). It's based on the idea that [any
    oppression form](#how-to-identify-fascism) can't be allowed, and should be
    actively fought with whatever means are necessary.

### [Antifascist Actions](antifascist_actions.md)

* New: [A fake company and five million recycled flyers.](antifascist_actions.md#a-fake-company-and-five-million-recycled-flyers)

    A group of artists belonging to the [Center for political
    beauty](https://politicalbeauty.com/) created a fake company [Flyerservice
    Hahn](https://www.flyerservice-hahn.de/) and convinced more than 80 regional
    sections of the far right party AfD to hire them to deliver their electoral
    propaganda.

    They gathered five million flyers, with a total weight of 72 tons. They justify
    that they wouldn't be able to lie to the people, so they did nothing in the
    broader sense of the word. They declared that they are the ["world wide leader in
    the non-delivery of nazi
    propaganda"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBVq-PtrpY). At the start of the
    electoral campaign, they went to the AfD stands, and they let their members to
    give them flyers the throw them to the closest bin. "It's something that any
    citizen can freely do, we have only industrialized the process".

    They've done a [crowdfunding](https://afd-muell.de/) to fund the legal process
    that may result.


## Feminism

### [Privileges](privileges.md)

* New: Feminist analysis of privileges and rights.

    Privileges are a group of special structural benefits, social advantages, that a group
    holds over another. So they are elements that should be removed from our lives.

    Some of the topics included are:

    * What's the difference between privilege and right
    * [What can we do to fight the privileges?](privileges.md#what-can-we-do-to-fight-the-privileges)

## [Free Knowledge](free_knowledge.md)

* New: Introduce how to contribute to the free knowledge initiative.

    One of the early principles of the internet has been to make knowledge free to everyone. [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan) of [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.do/), bookwarrior of [Library Genesis](https://libgen.fun/), [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), and countless unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers.  Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open Science.

    If you want to know how to contribute, check the [article](free_knowledge.md).

# [Life Management](life_management.md)

* Reorganization: Split the life automation article into life management and process automation.

    I understand life management as the act of analyzing yourself and your
    interactions with the world to define processes and automations that shape the
    way to efficiently achieve your goals.

    I understand process automation as the act of analyzing yourself and your
    interactions with the world to find the way to reduce the time or willpower
    spent on your life processes.

## [Time Management](time_management.md)

* New: Introduce the time management concept.

    [Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is the process
    of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific
    activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity.
    It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work,
    social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the
    finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending
    or managing activities at their own time and expediency.

* New: Start analyzing the ways to reduce the time spent doing unproductive tasks.

    By [minimizing the context switches](time_management.md#minimize-the-context-switches) and [managing the interruptions](time_management.md#interruption-management).

* Improvement: [Explain how to improve your efficiency by better using your everyday tools.](time_management.md#tool-management)
* Improvement: Add two more ways to avoid loosing time in unproductive tasks.

    * [Avoid lost time doing nothing](time_management.md#avoid-lost-time-doing-nothing).
    * [Fix your environment](time_management.md#fix-your-environment).


* New: [Explain how to manage meetings efficiently.](time_management.md#meetings)
* New: [Explain how to improve efficiency by taking care of yourself.](time_management.md#improve-your-state)
* New: [Explain how to prevent blocks by efficiently switching mental processes.](time_management.md#don't-wait,-switch-task)

## [Task Management](task_management.md)

* New: Introduce the task management concept.

    [Task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management) is the process
    of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing,
    tracking, and reporting. Task management can help either individual achieve
    goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the
    accomplishment of collective goals.

* Improvement: Introduce the main task management tools.

    The [inbox](task_management.md#inbox) does not refer only to your e-mail
    inbox. It is a broader concept that includes all the elements you have
    collected in different ways: tasks you have to do, ideas you have
    thought of, notes, bills, business cards, etc…

    The [task manager](task_management.md#task-manager) tool to make your
    interaction with the tasks easier. You can start with the [simplest task
    manager](task_management.md#the-simplest-task-manager), a markdown file
    in your computer with a list of tasks to do. Annotate only the
    actionable tasks that you need to do today, otherwise it can quickly
    grow to be unmanageable.

* Improvement: Add the benefits when you do task management well, and the side effects if you do it wrong.
* Improvement: Add a small guide on how to introduce yourself into task management.

### [Task Management Workflows](task_workflows.md)

* New: Introduce the main task management workflows.

    Task management can be done at different levels. All of them help you in
    different ways to reduce the mental load, each also gives you extra benefits
    that can't be gained by the others. Going from lowest to highest abstraction
    level we have:

    * Pomodoro.
    * Task plan.
    * Day plan.
    * Week plan.
    * Month plan.
    * Semester plan.

    In the commit I've detailed the [Pomodoro technique](task_workflows.md#pomodoro) and the [task](task_workflows.md#task-plan), [day](task_workflows.md#day-plan) and [week](task_workflows.md#week-plan) plans.

* New: [Explain the difference of surfing the hype flow versus following a defined plan.](task_workflows.md#hype-flow-versus-a-defined-plan)

## [Interruption Management](interruption_management.md)

* New: Introduce the interruption management concept.

    Interruption management is the [life management](life_management.md) area that
    gathers the processes to minimize the time and willpower toll consumed by
    interruptions.

    The article proposes a way to analyze your existent interruptions and define how can you improve your interaction with them. I've applied it both to my [work](work_interruption_analysis.md) and [personal](personal_interruption_analysis.md) interruptions.

* Improvement: [Explain what to do once you have the interruption analysis.](interruption_management.md#workflow)

### [Work Interruption Analysis](work_interruption_analysis.md)

* Improvement: Add analysis of instant message interruptions.

### [Personal Interruption Analysis](personal_interruption_analysis.md)

* Improvement: Add analysis of instant message interruptions.

## [Money Management](money_management.md)

* Reorganization: Move the accounting automation to money management.

## [Email Management](email_management.md)

* New: Explain how I configure and interact with email efficiently.

### [Email Automation](email_automation.md)

* New: Explain how setup an infrastructure to automate.

## [Music Management](music_management.md)

* New: Introduce how I manage my music library.

### [MusicBrainz](musicbrainz.md)

* New: How to contribute to MusicBrainz.

    [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) is an open music encyclopedia that
    collects music metadata and makes it available to the public.

    MusicBrainz aims to be:

    * The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute and
        releasing the data under open licenses.
    * The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous
        form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have
        meaningful conversations about music.

    Like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz is maintained by a global community of users and we
    want everyone — including you — to [participate and contribute](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Contribute).


## [Book Management](book_management.md)

* New: Introduce the book management concept.

    Book management is the set of systems and processes to get and categorize books
    so it's easy to browse and discover new content. It involves the next actions:

    * Automatically index and download metadata of new books.
    * Notify the user when a new book is added.
    * Monitor the books of an author, and get them once they are released.
    * Send books to the e-reader.
    * A nice interface to browse the existent library, with the possibility of
        filtering by author, genre, years, tags or series.
    * An interface to preview or read the items.
    * An interface to rate and review library items.
    * An interface to discover new content based on the ratings and item metadata.

    I haven't yet found a single piece of software that fulfills all these needs, in the article I tell you about [Readarr](https://readarr.com/), [Calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web), [calibre]((https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/), [Polar bookself](https://getpolarized.io/), [GCStar](http://www.gcstar.org/), and how they interact with each other.

* Improvement: Add link to the calibre-web kobo integration project.

## [Map Management](map_management.md)

* New: How I manage maps in my life.

    For navigating on the go, I strongly recommend [OSMand+](osmand.md), for
    browsing maps in the browser, use [OpenStreetMaps](https://osm.org) or
    [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org) if you want to move by bike.

    To plan routes, you can use [brouter.de](https://brouter.de/brouter-web), it works perfectly for bikes. For hiking is awesome too, it shows you a lot of data needed to plan your tracks (check the settings on the right). If you want to invest a little more time, you can even set your [personalize profiles](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki/Hiking-profiles), so that the routing algorithm prioritizes the routes to your desires. It's based on [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and both can be [self-hosted](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web), although [brouter does not yet use Docker](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter/issues/359).

## [Instant Messages Management](instant_messages_management.md)

* New: Explain how I configure and interact with chat applications efficiently.

## [Process Automation](process_automation.md)

* Improvement: Add xkcd comics that gather the essence and pitfalls of process automation.

### [Virtual Assistant](virtual_assistant.md)

* New: Introduce project with kalliope.
* New: Explain the Speech-To-Text open source solutions.

# Health

## [Sleep](sleep.md)

* New: [Explain the sleep cycle.](sleep.md#the-sleep-cycle)

    Humans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the
    night with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid
    eye movement (REM).

    I answer the questions:

    * What is the period of the REM/NREM cycle?
    * What happens to your body in REM and NREM phases?
    * How does the ratio of REM/NREM changes throughout the night? with
        a possible explanation.
    * Why sleeping 6 hours can make you loose up to 90% of your REM or NREM phases?

* New: [Explain sleeping time and sense distortions.](sleep.md#sleeping-time-and-sense-distortions)

    Answer the questions:

    * Why time feels longer in our dreams?
    * How do we loose awareness of the outside world when sleeping?


## [Teeth](teeth.md)

* New: Explain how to take care of your teeth.

    A full guide on why should you take care of your teeth, the description
    on how the basic oral diseases work, why and how to brush your teeth, floss and usage of mouthwash

* Correction: Recommend a regular clean instead of a deep clean.

### [Deep cleaning](teeth_deep_cleaning.md)

* New: Explain what a deep cleaning is and when should you do it.

    Analyze the reasons why would you need to do this procedure, how it
    works, when you need to do it, side effects and scientific evidences of
    it's effectiveness.


## [Fitness Tracker](fitness_band.md)

* New: Introduce the fitness band in your life automation.

    [Fitness tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_tracker) or activity
    trackers are devices or applications for monitoring and tracking fitness-related
    metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases
    heartbeat. It is a type of wearable computer.

    Explain also why it's interesting

* Improvement: Discovery of wasp-os and Colmi P8.

    [wasp-os](https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os) is an open source
    firmware for smart watches that are based on the nRF52 family of
    microcontrollers. Fully supported by [gadgetbridge](gadgetbridge.md),
    Wasp-os features full heart rate monitoring and step counting support
    together with multiple clock faces, a stopwatch, an alarm clock,
    a countdown timer, a calculator and lots of other games and utilities.
    All of this, and still with access to the MicroPython REPL for
    interactive tweaking, development and testing.

    One of the supported devices, the [Colmi
    P8](https://wasp-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#colmi-p8),
    looks really good.

### [Amazfit Band 5](amazfit_band_5.md)

* New: Add insights on sleep detection.

    The sleep tracking using Gadgetbridge is not [good at
    all](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Huami-Deep-Sleep-Detection).
    After two nights, the band has not been able to detect when I woke in the middle
    of the night, or when I really woke up, as I usually stay in the bed for a time
    before standing up. I'll try with the proprietary application soon and compare results.

* New: Explain how to upgrade the firmware.

    Gadgetbridge people have a [guide on how to upgrade the
    firmware](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Amazfit-Band-5-Firmware-Update),
    you need to get the firmware from the [geek doing
    forum](https://geekdoing.com/threads/amazfit-band-5-original-firmwares-resources-fonts.2331/)
    though, so it is interesting to create an account and watch the post.

* Improvement: Add insights on sleep tracking.

    You can't use the Withings sleep analyzer without their app (as
    expected), maybe the [Emfit
    QS](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/master/my/emfit/__init__.py)
    is the way to go.

# [Coding](vuejs.md)

* New: Introduce Vue.js.

    [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) is a progressive framework for building user
    interfaces.

## Generic Coding Practices

### [Program Versioning](versioning.md)

* New: Define how to use versioning in software.

    A **long** article on how to use versioning both as a developer and as a consumer. It includes:

    * [Deciding what version system to use for your programs](versioning.md#deciding-what-version-system-to-use-for-your-programs).
    * [How to evolve your code version](versioning.md#how-to-evolve-your-code-version).
    * [Deciding how to manage the versions of your dependencies](versioning.md#deciding-how-to-manage-the-versions-of-your-dependencies).
    * A huge rant on [Upper version pinning](versioning.md#upper-version-pinning).
    * [When to use lower version pinning](versioning.md#lower-version-pinning).
    * [How to automatically upgrade and test your dependencies](versioning.md#automatically-upgrade-and-test-your-dependencies).
    * [Monitor your dependencies evolution](versioning.md#monitor-your-dependencies-evolution).


### [Keep a Changelog](semantic_versioning.md)

* New: Introduce the Changelog practice.

    A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

    It's purpose is to make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

    In the article we added:

    * [Guidelines](changelog.md#changelog-guidelines) on how to build good changelogs
    * [How to reduce the effort required to maintain a changelog](changelog.md#how-to-reduce-the-effort-required-to-maintain-a-changelog)

* New: Introduce Semantic Versioning.

    [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is a way to define your program's version based on the type of changes you've introduced. It's defined as a three-number string (separated with a period) in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

    Also included in the article is:

    * [When to do a major release](semantic_versioning.md#when-to-do-a-major-release).
    * [Semantic versioning system problems](semantic_versioning.md#semantic-versioning-system-problems).

### [Calendar Versioning](documentation.md)

* New: Start explaining how to write good documentation for a software project.

    It doesn't matter how good your program is, because if its documentation is not
    good enough, people will not use it.

    People working with software need different kinds of documentation at different
    times, in different circumstances, so good software documentation needs them
    all. In this first iteration, I define the five kinds of documentation,
    and give the ideas to write good introduction and get started sections.

* New: Introduce Calendar Versioning.

    [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) is a versioning convention based on
    your project's release calendar, instead of arbitrary numbers.

    CalVer suggests version number to be in format of: `YEAR.MONTH.sequence`. For example, `20.1` indicates a release in 2020 January, while `20.5.2` indicates a release that occurred in 2020 May, while the `2` indicates this is the third release of the month.

## [Python](python.md)

* New: Explain how to check if a loop ends completely.
* New: Explain how to merge lists and dictionaries.
* New: Explain how to create your own exceptions.
* New: Add python landing page.
* Improvement: Add aiomultiprocess to the list of libraries to test.

    [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess): Presents
    a simple interface, while running a full AsyncIO event loop on each
    child process, enabling levels of concurrency never before seen in
    a Python application. Each child process can execute multiple coroutines
    at once, limited only by the workload and number of cores available.


* New: [Add interesting links on how to write good documentation.](python.md#how-to-write-good-documentation)

    I would like to refactor
    [divio's](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) and
    [Vue's](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/contributing/writing-guide.html#principles)
    guidelines and apply it to my projects.

* Improvement: Add FastAPI docs as a model to study and follow.
* New: Add apprise to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise): Allows you to send
    a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services
    available to us today such as: Linux, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon
    SNS, Gotify, etc. Look at [all the supported notifications](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)
    `(¬º-°)¬`.


* New: Add kivi and kivimd to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [kivi](https://kivy.org/) is used to create android/Linux/iOS/Windows applications with python. Use it with [kivimd](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) to make it beautiful, check [the examples](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/Articles) and the [docs](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


* New: Add parso library to interesting libraries to explore.

    [parso](https://github.com/davidhalter/parso) is a library to parse Python code.


* Improvement: Add textual as interesting library to explore.

    [textual](https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual): Textual is a TUI (Text User Interface) framework for Python using Rich as a renderer.

* New: Add schedule to interesting libraries to explore.

    [schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) is a Python job scheduling for humans. Run Python functions (or any other callable) periodically using a friendly syntax.


* New: Add tryceratops to interesting linters to try.

    [tryceratops](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops) is a linter of exceptions.

### [Pydantic Field Types](asyncio.md)

* New: Introduce the asyncio library.

    [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is a library to write
    concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

    asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that
    provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries,
    distributed task queues, etc.

    asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network
    code.

* New: [Limit concurrency.](asyncio.md#limit-concurrency)

    Use [`asyncio.Semaphore`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphores).

    ```python
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    ```

* New: [Using constrained strings in list attributes.](pydantic_types.md#using-constrained-strings-in-list-attributes)

    ```python
    import re
    import pydantic
    from pydantic import Field
    from typing import List

    class Regex(pydantic.ConstrainedStr):
        regex = re.compile("^[0-9a-z_]*$")

    class Data(pydantic.BaseModel):
        regex: List[Regex]

    data = Data(**{"regex": ["abc", "123", "asdf"]})
    print(data)
    print(data.json())
    ```

### [Pipenv](requests_mock.md)

* New: Explain how to set cookies and headers in responses.
* New: Introduce the AWS SDK library and explain how to test it.

    [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is
    the AWS SDK for Python to create, configure, and manage AWS services,
    such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3). The SDK provides an object-oriented API as well as
    low-level access to AWS services.

    For [testing](boto3.md#testing), try to use [moto](boto3.md#moto), using the [Botocore's stubber](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/stubber.html) as fallback option.

* New: Explain how to test ec2, route53, s3, and rds resources.
* New: Explain how to test vpc and auto scaling group resources.
* Improvement: Explain how to extract the instance when testing autoscaling groups.

    Also track the [issue to add support to launch templates](boto3.md#issues).

* New: [Explain how to test security groups.](boto3.md#test-security-groups)
* Correction: [Add note that pagination is not yet supported when testing route53.](boto3.md#test-route53)

    I've [opened an issue](https://github.com/spulec/moto/issues/3879) to
    solve it.


* New: [Explain how to test IAM users and groups.](boto3.md#test-iam-users)
* Improvement: Monitor motor issue with the `cn-north-1` rds and autoscaling endpoints.
* New: [Testing full screen applications.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#testing)
* New: [Pass more than one key.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#pass-more-than-one-key)

    To map an action to two key presses use `kb.add('g', 'g')`.

* New: [Add note on how to debug the styles of the components.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#styles)

    Set the style to `bg:#dc322f` and it will be highlighted in red.


* New: [How to use Conditional Containers.](prompt_toolkit_fullscreen_applications.md#conditional-containers)

    ```python
    from prompt_toolkit.layout import ConditionalContainer
    from prompt_toolkit.filters.utils import to_filter

    show_header = True
    ConditionalContainer(
        Label('This is an optional text'), filter=to_filter(show_header)
    )
    ```


* New: Introduce the pipenv package manager.

    [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is a tool that aims to bring the best
    of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the
    Python world.

### [Poetry](type_hints.md)

* Improvement: Explain how to ignore a linter error and a type error.

    With `# type: ignore # noqa: W0212`

* Improvement: [Explain how to define the type hints of functions and methods that use subclasses.](type_hints.md#allow-any-subclass)

    It's a complex topic that has taken me many months to get it right :).

* New: [Explain how to write type hints for generator functions.](type_hints.md#type-hints-of-generators)
* New: Explain how to log in using pass.

    ```bash
    pass show dockerhub | docker login --username foo --password-stdin
    ```

* New: Explain how not to store the credentials in plaintext.

    It doesn't work, don't go this painful road and assume that docker is broken.

    The official steps are horrible, and once you've spent two hours debugging
    them, you [won't be able to push or pull images with your
    user](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/issues/154).

* Improvement: Explain how to change the command line help description.
* New: [Explain how to use watchtower to keep docker containers updated.](docker.md#how-to-keep-containers-updated)

    With [watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) you can update the running
    version of your containerized app simply by pushing a new image to the Docker
    Hub or your own image registry. Watchtower will pull down your new image,
    gracefully shut down your existing container and restart it with the same
    options that were used when it was deployed initially.


* Correction: Explain how to run the watchtower checks immediately.

    With the `--run-once` flag


* New: [Invoke other commands from a command.](click.md#invoke-other-commands-from-a-command)

    This is a pattern that is generally discouraged with Click, but possible
    nonetheless. For this, you can use the `Context.invoke()` or `Context.forward()` methods.

* New: [Define a TypeVar with restrictions.](type_hints.md#define-a-typevar-with-restrictions)

    ```python
    from typing import TypeVar

    AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)
    ```

* New: [Use a constrained TypeVar in the definition of a class attributes.](type_hints.md#use-a-constrained-typevar-in-the-definition-of-a-class-attributes)

    If you try to use a `TypeVar` in the definition of a class attribute:

    ```python
    class File:
        """Model a computer file."""

        path: str
        content: Optional[AnyStr] = None # mypy error!
    ```

    [mypy](mypy.md) will complain with `Type variable AnyStr is unbound
    [valid-type]`, to solve it, you need to make the class inherit from the
    `Generic[AnyStr]`.

    ```python
    class File(Generic[AnyStr]):
        """Model a computer file."""

        path: str
        content: Optional[AnyStr] = None
    ```

* New: Deeply introduce Poetry, a python package manager.

    [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) is a command line program that
    helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of Python projects, ensuring
    you have the right stack everywhere.


* New: [Debugging why a package is not updated to the latest version.](python_poetry.md#debugging-why-a-package-is-not-updated-to-the-latest-version)
* New: [Checking what package is using a dependency.](python_poetry.md#checking-what-package-is-using-a-dependency)
* New: [Try to use `pass` as a keyring backend to store the PYPI token.](python_poetry.md#configuration)
* Correction: Warn against upper version pinning.

    The main problem is that `poetry add` does [upper pinning of dependencies](versioning.md#upper-version-pinning) by default, which is a **really bad idea**.

### [Dash](python_logging.md)

* New: Explain how to log python program exceptions better than to a file.

    Using `logging` to write write exceptions and breadcrumbs to a file
    might not be the best solution because unless you look at it directly
    most errors will pass unnoticed.

    To actively monitor and react to code exceptions use an application monitoring
    platform like [sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/).

    In the article I explain what are the advantages of using this solution
    and do a comparison between Sentry and [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com).

* New: [Testing Dash applications.](dash.md#testing)

    `dash.testing` provides some off-the-rack pytest fixtures and a minimal set of
    testing APIs with our internal crafted best practices at the integration
    level. The commit includes a simple example and some guides on how to test Dash application.

* New: [Test programs that use `sh`.](python_sh.md#testing)

    `sh` can be patched in your tests the typical way, with `unittest.mock.patch()`:

    ```python
    from unittest.mock import patch
    import sh

    def get_something():
        return sh.pwd()

    @patch("sh.pwd", create=True)
    def test_something(pwd):
        pwd.return_value = "/"
        assert get_something() == "/"
    ```

### [Code Styling](python_code_styling.md)

* Improvement: Don't use try-except to initialize dictionaries.

    Instead of:

    ```python
    try:
        dictionary['key']
    except KeyError:
        dictionary['key'] = {}
    ```

    Use:

    ```python
    dictionary.setdefault('key', {})
    ```

* New: Introduce the awesome, life saving library `pydantic_factories`.

    [Pydantic factories](https://github.com/Goldziher/pydantic-factories) is
    a library offers powerful mock data generation capabilities for pydantic based
    models and dataclasses. It automatically creates [FactoryBoy](factoryboy.md)
    factories from a [pydantic](pydantic.md) model.

    ```python
    from datetime import date, datetime
    from typing import List, Union

    from pydantic import BaseModel, UUID4

    from pydantic_factories import ModelFactory

    class Person(BaseModel):
        id: UUID4
        name: str
        hobbies: List[str]
        age: Union[float, int]
        birthday: Union[datetime, date]

    class PersonFactory(ModelFactory):
        __model__ = Person

    result = PersonFactory.build()
    ```

* Reorganization: Moved the semantic versioning commit guidelines to the semver article.

### [DeepDiff](deepdiff.md)

* Correction: Remove murmur from the installation steps.

    It seems it's the default for the new versions


* Improvement: Add warning that regular expressions are not yet supported.

    Until [#239](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) is merged, the
    official library doesn't support searching for regular expressions. You can
    use [my fork](https://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff) instead.

* Improvement: Remove advice to use my fork instead.

    The original one has already merged my [PR](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) `＼\ ٩( ᐛ )و /／`. Beware though as the `regexp` are not enabled by default (against my will). You need to use the `use_regexp=True` as an argument to `grep` or `DeepSearch`.

### [Properties](factoryboy.md)

* New: Explain how to generate your own attributes.

    We earlier used lazy_attribute but if you want to use Faker inside the
    attribute definition, you're going to have a bad time. The new solution
    uses the creation of custom Fake providers.

* New: [Explain how to use `Enum` with factoryboy.](factoryboy.md#word-from-enum-choices)
* New: [Automatically generate a factory from a pydantic model.](factoryboy.md#automatically-generate-a-factory-from-a-pydantic-model)

    Sadly [it's not yet supported](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/issues/869), [it will at some point though](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/issues/836). If you're interested in following this path, you can start with [mgaitan snippet](https://gist.github.com/mgaitan/dcbe08bf44a5af696f2af752624ac11b) for dataclasses.

* New: Give an overview on Python's @property decorator.

### [Package Management](faker.md)

* New: Explain how to create your own provider.

    Useful to generate custom objects for testing purposes.

* New: [Explain how to create `Optional` data.](faker.md#create-optional-data)

    [`faker-optional`](https://lyz-code.github.io/faker-optional/) is
    a custom faker provider that acts as a wrapper over other Faker providers to return their value or `None`. Useful to
    create data of type `Optional[Any]`.

* New: [Create a random string with a defined format.](faker.md#create-a-random-string-with-a-defined-format)

    ```python
    faker.pystr_format("id-#######{{random_letter}}")
    'id-6443059M'
    ```

* New: [Create an IP address.](faker.md#create-an-ip-address)

    ```python
    faker.ipv4()
    ```

    If you want a CIDR, use `network=True`.

* New: Compare Poetry, Pipenv and PDM package management tools.

    Pipenv has broad support. It is an official project of the Python Packaging
    Authority, alongside pip. It's also supported by the Heroku Python buildpack,
    which is useful for anyone with Heroku or Dokku-based deployment strategies.

    Poetry is a one-stop shop for dependency management and package management. It
    simplifies creating a package, managing its dependencies, and publishing it.
    Compared to Pipenv, Poetry's separate add and install commands are more
    explicit, and it's faster for everything except for a full dependency install.

    I liked Poetry most, and in the end I didn't analyze `pdm`.

* New: [Describe what a dependency solver does.](python_package_management.md#solver)

    A Solver tries to find a working set of dependencies that all agree with each other. By looking back in time, it’s happy to solve very old versions of packages if newer ones are supposed to be incompatible. This can be helpful, but is slow, and also means you can easily get a very ancient set of packages when
    you thought you were getting the latest versions.

    In the section we compare Pip's and Poetry's solver.

* New: [Add downsides of Poetry.](python_package_management.md#poetry)

    It does upper version capping by default, which is becoming [a big problem](versioning.md#upper-version-pinning) in the Python environment.

    This is specially useless when you add dependencies that follow [CalVer](calendar_versioning.md). `poetry add` packaging will still do `^21` for the version it adds. You shouldn’t be capping versions, but you really shouldn’t be capping CalVer.

    It's equally troublesome that it upper pins [the python version](versioning.md#pinning-the-python-version-is-special).

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: Introduce FastAPI the pydantic friendly python framework to build APIs.

    [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance),
    web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type
    hints.


* New: Sum up the basic documentation.

    Explain how to:

    * [Sending data to the server](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-server):
        Through [path parameters](fastapi.md#path-parameters), [query parameters](fastapi.md#query-parameters) and [body requests](fastapi.md#body-requests).
    * [Handle errors](fastapi.md#handling-errors).
    * [Update data](fastapi.md#updating-data)
    * [Configure OpenAPI](fastapi.md#openapi-configuration)
    * [Test FastAPI applications](fastapi.md#testing)

    And add a lot of [more interesting features](fastapi.md#interesting-features-to-explore) I've discovered.


* New: [Explain how to log exceptions to sentry.](fastapi.md#logging-to-sentry)
* New: [Explain how to send raw data to the client.](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-client)

    With the [`Response`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/#returning-a-custom-response) object.

* New: [Explain how to configure the application.](fastapi.md#configuration)
* New: [Explain how to inject a testing configuration in the tests.](fastapi.md#inject-testing-configuration)
* New: [Explain how to deploy it using Docker.](fastapi.md#deploy-with-docker)
* New: [Explain how to show logging messages in the logs.](fastapi.md#logging)
* New: [Explain how to make redirections with fastapi.](fastapi.md#create-redirections)
* New: [Explain how to run a FastAPI server in the background for testing purposes.](fastapi.md#run-a-fastapi-server-in-the-background-for-testing-purposes)
* Improvement: Add link to the Awesome FastAPI page.

### [Plugin System](python_plugin_system.md)

* New: Add beets system as a first approach.

    When building Python applications, it's good to develop the core of your
    program, and allow extension via plugins.

    I still don't know how to do it, but [Beets plugin system](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/plugins.html)
    looks awesome for a first start.


### [Flask Restplus](flask_restplus.md)

* New: Introduce the Flask-RESTPlus library.

    [Flask-RESTPlus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an
    extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs,
    but I'd use [FastAPI](fastapi.md) instead.

### [Optimization](python_optimization.md)

* New: [Add tips on how to optimize your python command line tools.](python_optimization.md#tips)

    * [Minimize the relative import statements on command line tools](#minimize-the-relative-import-statements-on-command-line-tools):

        When developing a library, it's common to expose the main objects into the
        package `__init__.py` under the variable `__all__`. The problem with command
        line programs is that each time you run the command it will load those objects,
        which can mean an increase of 0.5s or even a second for each command, which is
        unacceptable.
    * [Don't dynamically install the package](#dont-dynamically-install-the-package):

        If you install the package with `pip install -e .` you will see an increase on
        the load time of ~0.2s. It is useful to develop the package, but when you use
        it, do so from a virtualenv that installs it directly without the `-e` flag.


### [GitPython](gitpython.md)

* New: Introduce the python library.

    [GitPython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io) is a python library used to
    interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain, or low-level like
    git-plumbing.

    It provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data, and
    additionally allows you to access the git repository more directly using either
    a pure python implementation, or the faster, but more resource intensive git
    command implementation.

    Explain how to:

    * Initialize or load repositories.
    * Make commits.
    * Interact with the history.
    * Test applications that use it.

* Improvement: Explain how to get the working directory of a repo.

    Using the `working_dir` attribute.

    perf(python_snippets#Group a list of dictionaries by a specific key) Explain how to group a list of dictionaries by a specific key

    With `itertools.groupby`.

* New: [Clone a repository.](gitpython.md#clone-a-repository)

    ```python
    from git import Repo

    Repo.clone_from(git_url, repo_dir)
    ```

* New: [Create a branch.](gitpython.md#create-a-branch)

    ```python
    new_branch = repo.create_head('new_branch')
    assert repo.active_branch != new_branch # It's not checked out yet
    repo.head.reference = new_branch
    assert not repo.head.is_detached
    ```

* New: [Get the latest commit of a repository.](gitpython.md#get-the-latest-commit-of-a-repository)

    ```python
    repo.head.object.hexsha
    ```

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [Explain how to exclude code from the coverage report.](pytest.md#excluding-code-from-coverage)

    Add `# pragma: no cover`.

* New: [Explain how to run tests in parallel.](pytest.md#running-tests-in-parallel)

    `pytest-xdist` makes it possible to run the tests in parallel, useful when the
    test suit is large or when the tests are slow.

    ```bash
    pip install pytest-xdist
    pytest -n auto
    ```

* New: [Explain how to set a timeout for your tests.](pytest.md#setting-a-timeout-for-your-tests)

    Using [pytest-timeout](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-timeout/).

* New: [Explain how to rerun tests that fail sometimes.](pytest.md#rerun-tests-that-fail-sometimes)

    With [pytest-rerunfailures](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-rerunfailures/) that is
    a plugin for pytest that re-runs tests to eliminate intermittent failures. Using
    this plugin is generally a bad idea, it would be best to solve the reason why
    your code is not reliable. It's useful when you rely on non robust third party
    software in a way that you can't solve, or if the error is not in your code but
    in the testing code, and again you are not able to fix it.

    feat(python_snippets#Create combination of elements in groups of two):
    Explain how to create combination of elements in groups of two

    ```python
    >>> list(itertools.combinations('ABC', 2))
    [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C')]
    ```

* New: [Exclude the `if TYPE_CHECKING` code from the coverage.](pytest.md#excluding-code-from-coverage)

    If you want [other code to be
    excluded](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/831), for example the
    statements inside the `if TYPE_CHECKING:` add to your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```toml
    [tool.coverage.report]
    exclude_lines = [
        # Have to re-enable the standard pragma
        'pragma: no cover',

        # Type checking can not be tested
        'if TYPE_CHECKING:',
    ]
    ```

* New: Introduce goodconf the pyndantic YAML friendly configuration management.

    [goodconf](https://github.com/lincolnloop/goodconf/) is a thin wrapper over
    Pydantic's settings management. Allows you to define configuration variables and
    load them from environment or JSON/YAML file. Also generates initial
    configuration files and documentation for your defined configuration.

* New: [Capture deprecation warnings.](pytest.md#capture-deprecation-warnings)

    Python and its ecosystem does not have an assumption of strict SemVer, and has a tradition of providing deprecation warnings. If you have good CI, you should be able to catch warnings even before your users see them. Try the following pytest configuration:

    ```toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    filterwarnings = ["error"]
    ```

    This will turn warnings into errors and allow your CI to break before users break.

    Other sections added are:

    * [Ensuring code triggers a deprecation warning](pytest.md#ensuring-code-triggers-a-deprecation-warning).
    * [Asserting warnings with the warns function](pytest.md#asserting-warnings-with-the-warns-function).
    * [Recording warnings](pytest.md#recording-warnings).

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* Correction: Explain how to show the message in custom exceptions.
* New: Explain how to import a module or object from within a python program.

    widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution
    environment.

    Add installation, usage and basic and advanced template guidelines.


* New: Add date management snippets.

    * [Get the week number of a datetime](python_snippets.md#get-the-week-number-of-a-datetime): `datetime.datetime(2010, 6, 16).isocalendar()[1]`.

    * [Get the Monday of a week number](python_snippets.md#get-the-monday-of-a-week-number):

      ```python
      import datetime
      d = "2013-W26"
      r = datetime.datetime.strptime(d + '-1', "%Y-W%W-%w")
      ```

    * [Get the month name from a number](python_snippets.md#get-the-month-name-from-a-number):

      ```python
      import calendar

      >> calendar.month_name[3]
      'March'
      ```
    * [Get ordinal from number](python_snippets.md#get-ordinal-from-number)

      ```python
      def int_to_ordinal(number: int) -> str:
          '''Convert an integer into its ordinal representation.

          make_ordinal(0)   => '0th'

          make_ordinal(122) => '122nd'
          make_ordinal(213) => '213th'

          Args:
              number: Number to convert

          Returns:
              ordinal representation of the number
          '''
          suffix = ['th', 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th'][min(number % 10, 4)]
          if 11 <= (number % 100) <= 13:
              suffix = 'th'
          return f"{number}{suffix}"
      ```

* New: Add file management snippets.

* Improvement: [Get the first day of next month.](python_snippets.md#get-the-first-day-of-next-month)
* New: [Explain how to test directories and files.](python_snippets.md#check-directories-and-files)
* New: [Explain how to install dependencies from git repositories.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    With [pip you can](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16584552/how-to-state-in-requirements-txt-a-direct-github-source):

    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/path/to/repository@master
    ```

    If you want [to hard code it in your `setup.py`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32688688/how-to-write-setup-py-to-include-a-git-repository-as-a-dependency/54794506#54794506), you need to:

    ```python
    install_requires = [
      'some-pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/someorgname/pkg-repo-name@v1.1#egg=some-pkg',
    ]
    ```

* Correction: Explain how to create PyPI valid packages with direct dependencies.

    It looks like PyPI don't want pip to reach out to URLs outside their
    site when installing from PyPI. So you can't define the direct
    dependencies in the `install_requires`. Instead you need to install them
    in a `PostInstall` custom script. Ugly as hell.

* Correction: [Add warning about the method to use direct dependencies.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    Last time I used this solution, when I added the library on a `setup.py`
    the direct dependencies weren't installed :S

* New: [Explain how to convert html code to readable plaintext.](python_snippets.md#convert-html-to-readable-plaintext)

    ```bash
    pip install html2text

    html = open("foobar.html").read()
    print(html2text.html2text(html))
    ```

* New: [Explain how to parse a datetime from a string.](python_snippets.md#parse-a-datetime-from-a-string)

    ```python
    from dateutil import parser

    ```

* New: [Explain how to delete a file.](python_snippets.md#delete-a-file)

    ```python

    os.remove('demofile.txt')
    ```

* New: [Explain how to measure elapsed time between lines of code.](python_snippets.md#measure-elapsed-time-between-lines-of-code)

    ```python
    import time

    start = time.time()
    print("hello")
    end = time.time()
    print(end - start)
    ```

* New: [Document when to use `isinstance` and when to use `type`.](python_snippets.md#when-to-use-isinstance-and-when-to-use-type)

    `isinstance` takes into account inheritance, while `type` doesn't. So if
    you want to make sure you're dealing with a specific class, and not any
    of it's parents or subclasses, use `type(obj) == class`.

* New: [Check if a dictionary is a subset of another.](python_snippets.md#check-if-a-dictionary-is-a-subset-of-another)

    If you have two dictionaries `big = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c':3}` and `small = {'c':
    3, 'a': 1}`, and want to check whether `small` is a subset of `big`, use the
    next snippet:

    ```python
    >>> small.items() <= big.items()
    True
    ```

* Correction: [Group or sort a list of dictionaries or objects by a specific key.](python_snippets.md#group-or-sort-a-list-of-dictionaries-or-objects-by-a-specific-key)

    Improve previous method with the concepts learned from the [official
    docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sorting-basics)

    Particularly improve the sorting by multiple keys with the next
    function:

    ```python
    >>> def multisort(xs, specs):
        for key, reverse in reversed(specs):
            xs.sort(key=attrgetter(key), reverse=reverse)
        return xs

    >>> multisort(list(student_objects), (('grade', True), ('age', False)))
    [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
    ```


* Correction: [Install default directories and files for a command line program.](python_snippets.md#install-default-directories-and-files-for-a-command-line-program)

    I've been trying for a long time to configure `setup.py` to run the required
    steps to configure the required directories and files when doing `pip install`
    without success.

    Finally, I decided that the program itself should create the data once the
    `FileNotFoundError` exception is found. That way, you don't penalize the load
    time because if the file or directory exists, that code is not run.

* New: [Locate element in list.](python_snippets.md#locate-element-in-list)

    ```python
    a = ['a', 'b']

    index = a.index('b')
    ```

* New: [Transpose a list of lists.](python_snippets.md#transpose-a-list-of-lists)

    ```python
    >>> l=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
    >>> [list(i) for i in zip(*l)]
    ... [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
    ```

    ```python
    def _is_list_of_lists(data: Any) -> bool:
        """Check if data is a list of strings."""
        if data and isinstance(data, list):
            return all(isinstance(elem, list) for elem in data)
        else:
            return False
    ```

* New: [Replace all characters of a string with another character.](python_snippets.md#replace-all-characters-of-a-string-with-another-character)

    ```python

    ```

* New: [Make a flat list of lists with a list comprehension.](python_snippets.md#make-a-flat-list-of-lists-with-a-list-comprehension)

    There is no nice way to do it :(. The best I've found is:

    ```python
    t = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]]
    flat_list = [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]
    ```

* New: [Remove a substring from the end of a string.](python_snippets.md#remove-a-substring-from-the-end-of-a-string)

    On Python 3.9 and newer you can use the `removeprefix` and `removesuffix` methods to
    remove an entire substring from either side of the string:

    ```python
    url = 'abcdc.com'
    url.removesuffix('.com')    # Returns 'abcdc'
    url.removeprefix('abcdc.')  # Returns 'com'
    ```

    On Python 3.8 and older you can use `endswith` and slicing:

    ```python
    url = 'abcdc.com'
    if url.endswith('.com'):
        url = url[:-4]
    ```

* New: [Capture the stdout of a function.](python_snippets.md#capture-the-stdout-of-a-function)

    ```

* Correction: [Use fixture to change the working directory of a test.](python_snippets.md#change-the-working-directory-of-a-test)

    The previous code didn't work, instead use the next fixture:

    ```python
    @pytest.fixture(name="change_test_dir")
    def change_test_dir_(request: SubRequest) -> Any:
        os.chdir(request.fspath.dirname)

    Both [without a template](docstrings.md#without-template) and using the [Given When Then style](docstrings.md#given-when-then).

### [NetworkX](networkx.md)

* New: Introduce the python library.

    [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) is a Python package for the creation,
    manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex

### [pexpect](pexpect.md)

* New: Introduce the pexpect python library.

    A pure Python module for spawning
    child applications; controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in
    their output. Pexpect works like Don Libes’ Expect. Pexpect allows your script
    to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands.

* New: [Explain how to read the output of a command run by pexpect.](pexpect.md#read-output-of-command)

    ```python

### [Prompt Toolkit](prompt_toolkit.md)

* New: Introduce the tui python library.

    Useful to build text-based user interfaces, it allows the creation of
    intelligent prompts, dialogs, and full screen ncurses-like applications.


* New: [Basic concepts of building full screen applications with python prompt toolkit.](prompt_toolkit.md#full-screen-applications)

    `prompt_toolkit` can be used to create complex full screen terminal applications.
    Typically, an application consists of a layout (to describe the graphical part)
    and a set of key bindings.

    In the section we cover:

    * [The layout](prompt_toolkit.md#the-layout)
    * [The controls](prompt_toolkit.md#the-controls)
    * [How to use key bindings](prompt_toolkit.md#key-bindings)
    * [How to apply styles](prompt_toolkit.md#styles)
    * A difficult ordered list of [examples](prompt_toolkit.md#examples) to
    get a grasp of these concepts with simple working code.

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

    With the [`PrivateAttr`](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#private-model-attributes) object.

* New: [Explain how to update entity attributes with a dictionary.](pydantic.md#update-entity-attributes-with-a-dictionary)

    You can create a new object with the new data using the `update`
    argument of the `copy` entity method.

* New: [Copy produces copy that modifies the original.](pydantic.md#copy-produces-copy-that-modifies-the-original)

    When copying a model, changing the value of an attribute on the copy updates the
    value of the attribute on the original. This only happens if `deep != True`. To
    fix it use: `model.copy(deep=True)`.

* New: [Define fields to exclude from exporting at config level.](pydantic.md#define-fields-to-exclude-from-exporting-at-config-level)

    Eagerly waiting for the release of the version 1.9 because you can [define the fields to exclude in the `Config` of the model](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/660) using something like:

    ```python
    class User(BaseModel):
        id: int
        username: str
        password: str

    class Transaction(BaseModel):
        id: str
        user: User
        value: int

        class Config:
            fields = {
                'value': {
                    'alias': 'Amount',
                    'exclude': ...,
                },
                'user': {
                    'exclude': {'username', 'password'}
                },

                    'dump_alias': 'external_id'
                }
            }
    ```

    The release it's taking its time because [the developer's gremlin and salaried work are sucking his time off](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/discussions/3228).

* New: [Field customization.](pydantic.md#field-customization)

    Optionally, the `Field` function can be used to provide extra information about
    the field and validations. Such as the `title`, `default`, `description`
    and many others

### [Pypika](pypika.md)

### [questionary](questionary.md)

* New: Introduce tui python library.

    [questionary](https://questionary.readthedocs.io) is a Python library
    for effortlessly building pretty command line interfaces. It makes it
    very easy to query your user for input.


* Correction: Correct the link to the examples.
* New: [Conditionally skip questions.](questionary.md#conditionally-skip-questions)

    Sometimes it is helpful to be able to skip a question based on a condition. To
    avoid the need for an if around the question, you can pass the condition when
    you create the question:

    ```python
    import questionary

    DISABLED = True
    response = questionary.confirm("Are you amazed?").skip_if(DISABLED, default=True).ask()
    ```

* New: [Don't highlight the selected option by default.](questionary.md#don't-highlight-the-selected-option-by-default)

    If you don't want to highlight the default choice in the `select` question use
    the next style:

    ```python
    from questionary import Style

    choice = select(
        "Question title: ",
        choices=['a', 'b', 'c'],

    * Git graph
    * Entity Relationship
    * User journey

## [Issues](issues.md)

* New: Introduce the issue tracking document.

    I haven't found a tool to monitor the context it made me track certain
    software issues, so I get lost when updates come. Until a tool shows up,
    I'll use the good old markdown to keep track of them.


* New: Add today's issues.

    * Gadgetbridge improvements
    * Ombi improvements

* Improvement: Monitor today's issues.

    * Mkdocs migration to 7.x is giving errors with the search bar and repo
    stats.

* Improvement: Track python dependency errors.
* Correction: Gitdb has updated smmap.
* New: Jellyfin 10.7.1 broke the login page.

    Don't upgrade till it's solved, as the rollback is not easy.

* Correction: Jellyfin login page problem after upgrade to 10.7.X is solved.

    Surprisingly the instructions in
    [#5489](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/5489) solved it.

    ```bash
    systemctl stop jellyfin.service
    mv /var/lib/jellyfin/data/jellyfin.db{,.bak}
    systemctl start jellyfin.service

    [ Go to JF URL, get asked to log in even though there are no Users in the JF DB now]

    systemctl stop jellyfin.service
    mv /var/lib/jellyfin/data/jellyfin.db{.bak,}
    systemctl start jellyfin.service
    ```

# [DevOps](devops.md)

* New: Comment on the DevOps pitfalls and update the learn path.

## Infrastructure as Code

### [Helmfile](helmfile.md)

* Correction: [Improve the helmfile chart update process.](helmfile.md#keep-charts-updated)

    Updating charts with `helmfile` is easy as long as you don't use environments,
    you run `helmfile deps`, then `helmfile diff` and finally `helmfile apply`. The
    tricky business comes when you want to use environments to reuse your helmfile
    code and don't repeat yourself. I've updated the process to include
    this case.

* New: [Document the directory and files structure for multi-environment projects.](helmfile.md#multi-environment-project-structure)
* New: [Document how to use helmfile environments to follow DRY.](helmfile.md#using-helmfile-environments)
* New: [Document how to avoiding code repetition.](helmfile.md#avoiding-code-repetition)

    Besides environments, `helmfile` gives other useful tricks to prevent the
    illness of code repetition, such as [using release templates](helmfile.md#using-release-templates), or [layering the state](helmfile.md#layering-the-state).

* New: [Document how to manage dependencies between the charts, to be able to use concurrency.](helmfile.md#managing-dependencies)

    Helmfile support concurrency with the option `--concurrency=N` so we can take
    advantage of it and improve our deployment speed, but to ensure it works as
    expected we have to define the dependencies among charts. For example, if an
    application needs a database, it has to be deployed before hand.

* Correction: Use environment name instead of get values.

    Instead of `.Environment.Name`, in theory you could have used `.Vars | get "environment"`, which could have prevented the variables and secrets of the default environment will need to be called `default_values.yaml`, and `default_secrets.yaml`, which is misleading. But you can't use `.Values` in the `helmfile.yaml` as it's not loaded when the file is parsed, and you get an error. A solution would be to [layer the helmfile state files](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/blob/8594944f6374454e6ddea61d04b201133798cd95/docs/writing-helmfile.md#layering-state-template-files) but I wasn't able to make it work.

* New: How to install a chart only in one environment.

    ```yaml
    environments:
      default:
      production:

    ---

    releases:
    - name: newrelic-agent
      installed: {{ eq .Environment.Name "production" | toYaml }}
      # snip
    ```

* New: Add note that templates can't be used inside the secrets.

    See [this issue](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/issues/126)

### [Terraform](terraform.md)

* New: Introduce terraform and how to handle RDS secrets.

    [Terraform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)) is an
    open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It
    enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using
    an awful high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language
    (HCL), or optionally JSON. Terraform supports a number of cloud
    infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services, IBM Cloud
    , Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, Linode, Microsoft Azure,
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OVH, or VMware vSphere as well as
    OpenNebula and OpenStack.


* New: [Explain how to ignore the change of an attribute.](terraform.md#ignore-the-change-of-an-attribute)

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...

      lifecycle {
        ignore_changes = [
          # Ignore changes to tags, e.g. because a management agent
          # updates these based on some ruleset managed elsewhere.
          tags,
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

* New: [Explain how to define the default value of an variable that contains an object as empty.](terraform.md#define-the-default-value-of-an-variable-that-contains-an-object-as-empty)

    ```hcl
    variable "database" {
      type = object({
        size                 = number
        instance_type        = string
        storage_type         = string
        engine               = string
        engine_version       = string
        parameter_group_name = string
        multi_az             = bool
      })
      default     = null
    ```

* New: [Explain how to do a conditional if a variable is not null.](terraform.md#do-a-conditional-if-a-variable-is-not-null)

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_db_instance" "instance" {
      count                = var.database == null ? 0 : 1
      ...
    ```


* New: [How to do elif conditionals in terraform.](terraform.md#conditionals)

    ```terraform

    }
    ```

* New: [How to enable debug traces.](terraform.md#debugging)

    You can set the `TF_LOG` environmental variable to one of the log levels
    `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` or `ERROR` to change the verbosity of the logs.

* New: How to install the plugin.

### [Helm Git](helm_git.md)

* Correction: Suggest version 0.8.0 until issue is solved.

    Newer versions have
    a [bug](https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git/issues/131) that makes
    impossible to use helm_git with a repository that contains just one
    chart in the root of the git repository.

* Correction: Update installation method.

    In the last version 0.11.1, the issue that forced us to use the version
    0.8.0 was solved

## Infrastructure Solutions

### [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)

* New: [Add Velero as interesting tool.](kubernetes.md#tools-to-test)

    You can run a given set of workloads either on few large clusters (with many
    workloads in each cluster) or on many clusters (with few workloads in each
    cluster).

    Here's a table that summarizes the pros and cons of various approaches:

    ![ ](number_k8s_clusters.svg)
    *Figure: Possibilities of number of clusters from [learnk8s.io
    article](https://learnk8s.io/how-many-clusters)*

### [Jobs](kubernetes_jobs.md)

* Improvement: Remove false positive alerts on failed jobs that succeeded.

    A Kubernetes cronjob spawns jobs, if the first one fails, it will try to spawn a new one. If the second succeeds, the cronjob status should be success, but with the rule we had before, a successful job with failed past jobs will still raise an alert.


* New: [Explain how to rerun failed cronjobs.](kubernetes_jobs.md#rerunning-failed-jobs)

    If you have a job that has failed after the 6 default retries, it will show up
    in your monitorization forever, to fix it, you can manually trigger the job.

    ```bash
    kubectl get job "your-job" -o json \
        | jq 'del(.spec.selector)' \
        | jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)' \
        | kubectl replace --force -f -
    ```


* New: [Manually creating a job from a cronjob.](kubernetes_jobs.md#manually-creating-a-job-from-a-cronjob)

    ```bash
    kubectl create job {{ job_name }} -n {{ namespace }} \
        --from=cronjobs/{{ cronjob_name}}
    ```

## [Continuous Integration](ci.md)

* New: Explain how to troubleshoot the error: pathspec master did not match any file.

    Remove all git hooks with `rm -r .git/hooks`.


### [Flakehell](bandit.md)

* New: Explain how to ignore errors.
* Correction: Update the git repository.

    The existent repository has been archived in favor of [this one](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven)

* New: Explain how to patch the extended_default_ignore error for versions > 3.9.0.

    Add to your your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```ini
    [tool.flakeheaven]
    extended_default_ignore=[]  # add this
    ```

* New: [Troubleshoot the 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'extended_default_ignore' error.](flakeheaven.md#troubleshooting)

    Add to your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```ini
    [tool.flakeheaven]
    extended_default_ignore=[]
    ```

* New: [Latest version is broken.](flakeheaven.md#issues)

    It returns an [ImportError: cannot import name 'MergedConfigParser' from 'flake8.options.config'](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven/issues/22), wait for the issue to be solved before upgrading.

### [Pyment](pyment.md)

* New: Introduce Pyment.

    [Pyment](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment) is a python3 program to
    automatically create, update or convert docstrings in existing Python files,
    managing several styles.

    As of 2021-11-17, the program is not production ready yet for me, I've tested it
    in one of my projects and found some bugs that needed to be fixed before it's
    usable. Despite the number of stars, it looks like the development pace has
    dropped dramatically, so it needs our help to get better :).


### [Dependency managers](pip_tools.md)

* New: Sync the virtualenv libraries with the requirements files.

    ```python
    python -m piptools sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
    ```

* Correction: Use `-c` instead of `-r` in the nested requirement files.

    To avoid duplication of version pins.

* Correction: Deprecate in favour of Poetry.

## Automating Processes

### [cruft](cruft.md)

* New: [Monitor the issue to save the cruft config in `pyproject.toml`.](cruft.md#issues)

## Monitoring

### [Monitoring Comparison](monitoring_comparison.md)

* New: Compare Nagios and Prometheus as monitoring.
* Correction: Improve the comparison.

    * State that nagios is not easy to configure. If you're used to it it
        is, otherwise it's not.
    * Add that grafana has a huge community building graphs.
    * Mention Thanos as the long term storage solution for Prometheus.


* Correction: Add the insights of a nagios power user.

    * Update open source and community analysis with nagios exchange.

    !!! warning "Don't upgrade to 12.x if you're still using Helm 2."

### [Elasticsearch Exporter](elasticsearch_exporter.md)

* New: Introduce the prometheus elasticsearch exporter.

    The [elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter) allows
    monitoring [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md) clusters with [Prometheus](prometheus.md).

    Explain how to install it, configure the grafana dashboards and the
    alerts.


* Improvement: Add more elasticsearch alerts.

    Measure the search latency, search rate and create alerts on the garbage
    collector, json parser and circuit breaker errors


* New: Add alert on low number of healthy master nodes.

## [Scrum](scrum.md)

* New: Introduce the scrum framework.

    [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an
    [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for
    developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial
    emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such
    as personal task management.  It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,
    who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed
    iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two
    weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,
    called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to
    demonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and
    a sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks.

    In the article I explain:

    * I use to do [the meetings](scrum.md#the-meetings): [Daily](scrum.md#daily-meetings), [Refinement](scrum.md#refinement-meetings), [Retros](scrum.md#retro-meetings), [Reviews](scrum.md#review-meetings) and [Plannings](scrum.md#planning-meetings).
    * The relevant [roles](scrum.md#the-roles).
    * Some [definitions](scrum.md#definitions), such as definition of done
      and definition of ready.

# Software Architecture

## [Domain Driven Design](domain_driven_design.md)

* Improvement: Add warning when migrating old code.

    You may be tempted to migrate all your old code to this architecture once
    you fall in love with it. Truth being told, it's the best way to learn how to
    use it, but it's time expensive too! [The last
    refactor](https://github.com/lyz-code/clinv/pull/40) I did required a
    change of 60% of the code. The upside is that I reduced the total lines of
    code a 25%.


## [Architecture Decision Record](adr.md)

* New: Introduce the Architecture Decision Records.

    [ADR](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) are

    [Tahoe-LAFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe-LAFS) is a free and open,
    secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant, distributed data store and distributed
    file system.

    Tahoe-LAFS is a system that helps you to store files. You run a client program
    on your computer, which talks to one or more storage servers on other computers.
    When you tell your client to store a file, it will encrypt that file, encode it
    into multiple pieces, then spread those pieces out among multiple servers. The
    pieces are all encrypted and protected against modifications. Later, when you
    ask your client to retrieve the file, it will find the necessary pieces, make
    sure they haven’t been corrupted, reassemble them, and decrypt the result.


### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Explain how to split a file into many with equal number of lines.](linux_snippets.md#split-a-file-into-many-with-equal-number-of-lines)

    ```bash
    split -l 200000 filename
    ```

* New: [Explain how to identify what a string or file contains.](linux_snippets.md#identify-what-a-string-or-file-contains)

    fallocate -l 20G /path/to/file
    ```

* New: [Document how to bypass client SSL certificate with a cli tool.](linux_snippets.md#bypass-client-ssl-certificate-with-cli-tool)

    Websites that require clients to authorize with an TLS certificate are difficult
    to interact with through command line tools that don't support this feature.

    To solve it, we can use a transparent proxy that does the exchange for us.


### [afew](vim_tabs.md)

* New: Explain how to use tabs, buffers and windows in vim.
* New: Introduce afew.

    [afew](https://github.com/afewmail/afew) is an [initial tagging
    script](http://notmuchmail.org/initial_tagging/) for [notmuch
    mail](notmuch.md).

    Its basic task is to provide automatic tagging each time new mail is registered
    with `notmuch`. In a classic setup, you might call it after `notmuch new` in an
    offlineimap post sync hook.

### [alot](vim_plugins.md)

* New: [Follow the issue to add elipsis instead of ... in vim-abolish.](vim_plugins.md#issues)
* Correction: Forget to use abolish to insert the elipsis symbol.

    Tpope said that it's not going to happen.

* New: Introduce vim-easymotion.

    EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes the
    `<number>` out of `<number>w` or `<number>f{char}` by highlighting all possible
    choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.

    When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding or
    following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.

* Reorganization: Move vim-test to the plugins page.
* Correction: Typo.

    There was a missing comma in the list.

* Improvement: [Explain how to configure the vim-easymotion movement keys.](vim_plugins.md#vim-easymotion)
* New: Introduce alot.

    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) is a terminal-based mail user agent based
    on the [notmuch mail indexer](notmuch.md). It is written in python using the
    urwid toolkit and features a modular and command prompt driven interface to
    provide a full MUA experience.

### [ActivityWatch](activitywatch.md)

* New: Introduce ActivityWatch tracking software.

    It's a web application that can be installed both in Linux and Android
    that automatically tracks where you spend the time on.

    Super interesting for life logging and automating stuff. Until I save
    some time to react on the data, I'll just gather it and see how to
    aggregate it.

* Improvement: Add week insights.

    * [The browser watcher is not very accurate](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web/issues/20).
    * The vim editor watcher doesn't add [git branch information](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-vim/issues/19).

    improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it
    provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

### [dunst](dunst.md)

* New: Introduce dunst.

    [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) is a lightweight replacement for the
    notification daemons provided by most desktop environments. It’s very
    customizable, isn’t dependent on any toolkits, and therefore fits into those
    window manager centric setups we all love to customize to perfection.

### [Dynamic DNS](dynamicdns.md)

* New: Introduce the Dynamic DNS concept.

    [Dynamic DNS (DDNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) is a method of
    automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name Server (DNS), often in
    real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames,
    addresses or other information.

### [elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md)

* New: Explain how to reindex an index.
* Correction: Explain how to restore only some indices.

    ```bash

    includes some tips like how to send a test message to check an input.

### [HAProxy](haproxy.md)

* New: Add interesting guidelines on [how to configure HAProxy in AWS](https://github.com/jvehent/haproxy-aws).

### [Hard drive health](hard_drive_health.md)

* New: Taking care of your hard drives.

    Hard drives die, so we must be ready for that to happen. There are several
    solutions, such as using [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) to minimize
    the impact of a disk loss, but even then, we should monitor the [bad
    sectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_sector) to see when are our disks
    dying.

    In the article we talk about [S.M.A.R.T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.) and how to solve some hard drive problems.

    devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and
    ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There
    are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas:
    just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.

    dpkg -i jellyfin-ffmpeg_4.3.2-1-focal_amd64.deb
    ```


* Improvement: [Explain how to fix the wrong image covers.](jellyfin.md#wrong-image-covers)

    Remove all the `jpg` files of the directory and then fetch again the data from
    your favourite media management software.

* New: [Explain how to fix the green bars in the reproduction.](jellyfin.md#green-bars-in-the-reproduction)
* Correction: [Fix the stuck at login page error.](jellyfin.md#stuck-at-login-page)

    If you use [jfa-go](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go) for the invites, you may
    [need to regenerate all the user
    profiles](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go/issues/101), so that the problem is
    not introduced again.

    emulator written in C and Python with nice features for the keyboard driven
    humans like me.

* New: [Scrollback when ssh into a machine doesn't work.](kitty.md#scrollback-when-ssh-into-a-machine-doesn't-work)

    This happens because the kitty terminfo files are not available on the server.
    You can ssh in using the following command which will automatically copy the
    terminfo files to the server:

    ```bash
    kitty +kitten ssh myserver
    ```

* New: Enable infinite scrollback history.

    To make the history scrollback infinite add the next lines:

    ```
    scrollback_lines -1
    scrollback_pager_history_size 0
    ```

* New: [Reasons to migrate from urxvt to kitty.](kitty.md#reasons-to-migrate-from-urxvt-to-kitty)

* New: Explain how to develop your own plugins.
* New: Document the Navigation object and the on_nav event.

    Useful if you develop MkDocs plugins, it holds the information to build
    the navigation of the site.

* New: Describe navigation objects used in plugins.

    Explain how to use the [Page](mkdocs.md#page),
    [Section](mkdocs.md#section), and [SectionPage](mkdocs.md#sectionpage) objects.

* Correction: You need to edit the nav in the on_nav and not in the on_files event.

    Even though it seems more easy to create the nav structure in the
    [`on_files`](#on_files) event, by editing the `nav` dictionary of the `config`
    object, there is no way of returning the `config` object in that event, so we're
    forced to do it in this event.

* Correction: [Explain how to add files through a plugin.](mkdocs.md#adding-new-files)

    Long story short, use the `on_config` event instead of `on_files` and
    `on_nav` if you need to add files and want to change the navigation
    menu.

* New: Explain how to use MermaidJS diagrams.
* New: Explain how to test mkdocs plugins.

    [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is a simple animated GIF screen recorder
    with an easy to use interface.

    If you try to use it with i3, you're going to have a bad time, you'd
    [need to
    install](https://github.com/phw/peek#on-i3-the-recording-area-is-all-black-how-can-i-record-anything)
    [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), and then the elements [may
    not even be
    clickable](https://github.com/phw/peek#why-cant-i-interact-with-the-ui-elements-inside-the-recording-area).

    maps.

### [Signal](signal.md)

* New: Introduce the messaging app and how to decrypt the backups.

# Arts

## [Writing](writing.md)

* New: Try vim-pencil without success, but love mdnav.

    [mdnav](https://github.com/chmp/mdnav) opens links to urls or files when
    pressing `enter` in normal mode over a markdown link, similar to `gx`
    but more powerful. I specially like the ability of following `[self
    referencing link][]` links, that allows storing the links at the bottom.


* New: [Explain when to use I'm good or I'm well.](writing.md#im-good-or-im-well)

    Use I'm well when referring to being ill, use I'm good for the rest.

* New: [Explain where to add your pronouns.](orthography.md#where-to-add-your-pronouns)

    > Hi, I’m Lyz (he/him), I'm writing to tell you…

* New: [Explain when to capitalize after a question mark.](orthography.md#when-to-capitalize-after-a-question-mark)

    If the sentence ends after the question mark you should capitalize, if it
    doesn't end, you shouldn't have used the question mark, since it ends
    a sentence.

* New: Add textstat tests.

    To analyze the text readability


* New: [Explain how to use the singular `they`.](orthography.md#how-to-use-the-singular-they)

    Collocation refers to a natural combination of words that are closely affiliated
    with each other. They make it easier to avoid overused or ambiguous words like
    "very", "nice", or "beautiful", by using a pair of words that fit the context
    better and that have a more precise meaning.


* New: [Explain what can you use instead of I know.](orthography.md#stop-saying-i-know)

    Using "I know" may not be the best way to show the other person that you've got
    the information. You can take the chance to use other words that additionally
    gives more context on how you stand with the information you've received,
    thus improving the communication and creating a bond.


* New: [Explain the use of z or s in some words.](orthography.md#use-of-z-or-s-in-some-words)

    It looks like American english uses `z` while British uses `s`, some examples:

    * [Organizations vs organisation](https://writingexplained.org/organisation-vs-organization-difference).
    * [Authorization vs authorisation](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/282621/authorization-vs-authorisation-im-in-some-real-dilemma).
    * [Customized vs customised](https://grammarist.com/spelling/customise-customize/).

    Both forms are correct, so choose the one that suits your liking.


### [Forking this garden](writing_style.md)

* New: [Analyze interesting books on writing style.](writing_style.md#writing-style-books)

    * The elements of style by William Strunk Jr and E.B White

## [Pilates](pilates.md)

* New: Introduce the art.

    [Pilates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates) is a physical fitness system
    based on controlled movements putting emphasis on alignment, breathing,
    developing a strong core, and improving coordination and balance. The core (or
    powerhouse), consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back, and hips, is
    thought to be the key to a person's stability.

    Pilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of
    difficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of
    the instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations. Intensity
    can be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises.

    You can think of yoga, but without the spiritual aspects.

    Also added:

    * It's principles
    * The [swing from table](pilates.md#swing-from-table) exercise.

## Board Gaming

### [Regicide](regicide.md)

* New: Introduce the awesome Regicide card game.

    [Regicide](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/) is a wonderful cooperative card game for 1 to 4 players. It's awesome how they've built such a rich game dynamic with a normal deck of cards. Even if you can play it with any deck, I suggest to buy [the deck they sell](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/buy-regicide) because their cards are magnificent and they deserve the money for their impressive game. Another thing I love about them is that even if you can't or don't want to pay for the game, they give the [rules for free](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/assets/RegicideRulesA4.pdf?v=2).

    If you don't like reading the rules directly from their pdf (although it's quite short), they explain them in [this video](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/regicide).

    I've loved the game so much, that I've created some variations of the
    rules to make each game more different and changeling.


## [Drawing](drawing.md)

* New: [How to draw Ellipses.](drawing.md#ellipses)

    Ellipses are the next basic shape we're going to study (after the lines). They
    are extremely important and notoriously annoying to draw. Important because
    we're going to be using ellipses in 2D space to represent circles that exist in
    3D space.

    In this section we:

    * Introduce the basic concepts surrounding the ellipses
    * [How to draw them](drawing.md#drawing-ellipses).

### [Exercise Pool](exercise_pool.md)

* New: [Add the Tables of ellipses drawing exercise.](exercise_pool.md#ellipses)

    This exercise is meant to get you used to drawing ellipses, in a variety of
    sizes, orientations and degrees. It also sets out a clear space each ellipse is
    meant to occupy, giving us a means to assess whether or not an ellipse was
    successful, or if there were visible mistakes (where it went outside of its
    allotted space, or ended up falling short). Practicing against set criteria,
    with a way to judge success/failure is an important element of learning. There's
    nothing wrong with failure - it's an opportunity to learn. Having a clearly
    defined task allows us to analyze those failures and make the most of them.


## [Origami](origami.md)

* New: Add mark1626 digital garden article on origamis.

# [Contact](contact.md)

* New: Suggest organize to act on computer file changes.

    [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks good for
    automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it with
    [inotifywait](https://askubuntu.com/a/819290) instead of with a [cron
    job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).

* New: Introduce Outrun.

    [Outrun](https://github.com/Overv/outrun) lets you execute a local command using
    the processing power of another Linux machine.

* Correction: Broken links.

    Removed the link to (everything_i_know.md) since it no longer exists. Updated some links that where broken due to a folder structure change.

* New: Explain how to select a random choice from `Enum` objects.

    [pydantic](pydantic.md) uses `Enum` objects to define [the choices of
    fields](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#enums-and-choices), so
    we need them to create the factories of those objects.

* New: Improve the periodic tasks and application metrics monitoring.

    Setup an [healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) instance with the [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-healthchecks) to monitor cronjobs.

    For the notifications either use the [prometheus metrics](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_prometheus/) or an [apprise](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks/issues/271) compatible system.

* New: Explain how to check if an rsync command has gone well.

    Run `diff -r --brief source/ dest/`, and check that there is no output.

* Reorganization: Reorder the sections of the site navigation menu.

    Give more importance to Coding, Activism and Life Management, reducing
    the Software Architecture and Data Analysis sections.


* New: Introduce the tool management section.

    Most of the tasks or processes we do involve some kind of tool, the better you
    know how to use them, the better your efficiency will be. The more you use
    a tool, the more it's worth the investment of time to improve your usage of it.

    Whenever I use a tool, I try to think if I could configure it or use it in a way
    that will make it easier or quicker. Don't go crazy and try to change everything. Go
    step by step, and once you've internalized the improvement, implement the next.


* Reorganization: Move the tasks tools from the task management article to their own.
