### [Jobs](kubernetes_jobs.md)

* Improvement: Remove false positive alerts on failed jobs that succeeded.

    A Kubernetes cronjob spawns jobs, if the first one fails, it will try to spawn a new one. If the second succeeds, the cronjob status should be success, but with the rule we had before, a successful job with failed past jobs will still raise an alert.
