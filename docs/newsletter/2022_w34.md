* New: [Suggest a workflow to learn Git.](code_learning.md#git)

    [Git](git.md) is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually
    used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source
    code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and
    support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches
    running on different systems).
    
    Git is a tough nut to crack, no matter how experience you are you'll frequently
    get surprised. Sadly it's one of the main tools to develop your code, so you
    must master it as soon as possible.
    
    I've listed you some resources
    [here](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/git/?h=git#learning-git) on how to
    start. From that article I think it's also interesting that you read about:
    
    * [Pull Request process](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/git/?h=git#pull-request-process)
    * [Git workflow](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/git/?h=git#git-workflow)

## Languages

### [Bash snippets](bash_snippets.md)

* New: [Do the remainder or modulus of a number.](bash_snippets.md#do-the-remainder-or-modulus-of-a-number)

    ```bash
    expr 5 % 3
    ```

* New: [Update a json file with jq.](bash_snippets.md#update-a-json-file-with-jq)

    Save the next snippet to a file, for example `jqr` and add it to your `$PATH`.
    
    ```bash
    
    query="$1"
    file=$2
    
    temp_file="$(mktemp)"
    
    jq "$query" $file > "$temp_file"
    
    cmp -s "$file" "$temp_file"
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]] ; then
      /bin/rm "$temp_file"
    else
      /bin/mv "$temp_file" "$file"
    fi
    ```
    
    Imagine you have the next json file:
    
    ```json
    {
      "property": true,
      "other_property": "value"
    }
    ```
    
    Then you can run:
    
    ```bash
    jqr '.property = false' status.json
    ```
    
    And then you'll have:
    
    ```json
    {
      "property": false,
      "other_property": "value"
    }
    ```

    List the expected features from the recipe manager and add links of the
    software found after an analysis of the state of the art, it's still
    a work in progress
