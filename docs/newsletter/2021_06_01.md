# Software Architecture

## [Domain Driven Design](domain_driven_design.md)

* Improvement: Add warning when migrating old code.

    You may be tempted to migrate all your old code to this architecture once
    you fall in love with it. Truth being told, it's the best way to learn how to
    use it, but it's time expensive too! [The last
    refactor](https://github.com/lyz-code/clinv/pull/40) I did required a
    change of 60% of the code. The upside is that I reduced the total lines of
    code a 25%.
