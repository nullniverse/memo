# [Projects](projects.md)

* New: [Add seed to self host a routing web application.](projects.md#self-host-a-routing-web-application)

    Host and play around with [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and
    [brouter-web](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web).

# Life Management

## [Map Management](map_management.md)

* New: How I manage maps in my life.

    For navigating on the go, I strongly recommend [OSMand+](osmand.md), for
    browsing maps in the browser, use [OpenStreetMaps](https://osm.org) or
    [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org) if you want to move by bike.
    
    To plan routes, you can use [brouter.de](https://brouter.de/brouter-web), it works perfectly for bikes. For hiking is awesome too, it shows you a lot of data needed to plan your tracks (check the settings on the right). If you want to invest a little more time, you can even set your [personalize profiles](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki/Hiking-profiles), so that the routing algorithm prioritizes the routes to your desires. It's based on [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and both can be [self-hosted](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web), although [brouter does not yet use Docker](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter/issues/359).
