## [Continuous Integration](mdformat.md)

* New: Introduce MDFormat.

    [MDFormat](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an opinionated
    Markdown formatter that can be used to enforce a consistent style in Markdown
    files. Mdformat is a Unix-style command-line tool as well as a Python library.
    
    The features/opinions of the formatter include:
    
    * Consistent indentation and whitespace across the board
    * Always use ATX style headings
    * Move all link references to the bottom of the document (sorted by label)
    * Reformat indented code blocks as fenced code blocks
    * Use 1. as the ordered list marker if possible, also for noninitial list items.
    
    It's based on the
    [`markdown-it-py`](https://markdown-it-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    Markdown parser, which is a Python implementation of
    [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).
