### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Initialize a dataclass with kwargs.](python_snippets.md#initialize-a-dataclass-with-kwargs)

    If you care about accessing attributes by name, or if you can't distinguish
    between known and unknown arguments during initialisation, then your last resort
    without rewriting `__init__` (which pretty much defeats the purpose of using
    dataclasses in the first place) is writing a `@classmethod`:
    
    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from inspect import signature
    
    @dataclass
    class Container:
        user_id: int
        body: str
    
        @classmethod
        def from_kwargs(cls, **kwargs):
            # fetch the constructor's signature
            cls_fields = {field for field in signature(cls).parameters}
    
            # split the kwargs into native ones and new ones
            native_args, new_args = {}, {}
            for key, value in kwargs.items():
                if key in cls_fields:
                    native_args[key] = value
                else:
                    new_args[key] = value
    
            # use the native ones to create the class ...
            ret = cls(**native_args)
    
            # ... and add the new ones by hand
            for new_key, new_value in new_args.items():
                setattr(ret, new_key, new_value)
            return ret
    ```
    
    Usage:
    
    ```python
    params = {'user_id': 1, 'body': 'foo', 'bar': 'baz', 'amount': 10}
    Container(**params)  # still doesn't work, raises a TypeError
    c = Container.from_kwargs(**params)
    print(c.bar)  # prints: 'baz'
    ```

* New: [Replace a substring of a string.](python_snippets.md#replace-a-substring-of-a-string)

    ```python
    txt = "I like bananas"
    
    x = txt.replace("bananas", "apples")
    ```

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Scan a physical page in Linux.](linux_snippets.md#scan-a-physical-page-in-linux)

    Install `xsane` and run it.

### [Pipx](pipx.md)

* New: Introduce pipx.

    [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is a command line tool to install and run
    Python applications in isolated environments.
    
    Very useful not to pollute your user or device python environments.
    
    Install it with:
    
    ```bash
    pip install pipx
    ```
