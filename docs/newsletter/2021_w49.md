# Life Management

## [Music Management](music_management.md)

* New: Introduce how I manage my music library.

### [MusicBrainz](musicbrainz.md)

* New: How to contribute to MusicBrainz.

    [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) is an open music encyclopedia that
    collects music metadata and makes it available to the public.
    
    MusicBrainz aims to be:
    
    * The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute and
        releasing the data under open licenses.
    * The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous
        form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have
        meaningful conversations about music.
    
    Like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz is maintained by a global community of users and we
    want everyone — including you — to [participate and contribute](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Contribute).
    

# Coding

## Python

### [GitPython](gitpython.md)

* New: [Clone a repository.](gitpython.md#clone-a-repository)

    ```python
    from git import Repo
    
    Repo.clone_from(git_url, repo_dir)
    ```

* New: [Create a branch.](gitpython.md#create-a-branch)

    ```python
    new_branch = repo.create_head('new_branch')
    assert repo.active_branch != new_branch # It's not checked out yet
    repo.head.reference = new_branch
    assert not repo.head.is_detached
    ```

* New: [Get the latest commit of a repository.](gitpython.md#get-the-latest-commit-of-a-repository)

    ```python
    repo.head.object.hexsha
    ```

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Capture the stdout of a function.](python_snippets.md#capture-the-stdout-of-a-function)

    ```python
    import io
    from contextlib import redirect_stdout
    
    f = io.StringIO()
    with redirect_stdout(f):
        do_something(my_object)
    out = f.getvalue()
    ```

* New: [Make temporal directory.](python_snippets.md#make-temporal-directory)

    ```python
    import tempfile
    
    dirpath = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    ```

* New: [Change the working directory of a test.](python_snippets.md#change-the-working-directory-of-a-test)

    ```python
    import unittest
    import os
    
    from src.main import get_cwd
    
    class TestMain(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def test_get_cwd(self):
            os.chdir('src')
            print('testing get_cwd()')
            current_dir = get_cwd()
            self.assertIsNotNone(current_dir)
            self.assertEqual(current_dir, 'src')
    ```

* New: [Copy a directory.](python_snippets.md#copy-a-directory)

    ```python
    import shutil
    
    shutil.copytree('bar', 'foo')
    ```

* Correction: [Use fixture to change the working directory of a test.](python_snippets.md#change-the-working-directory-of-a-test)

    The previous code didn't work, instead use the next fixture:
    
    ```python
    @pytest.fixture(name="change_test_dir")
    def change_test_dir_(request: SubRequest) -> Any:
        os.chdir(request.fspath.dirname)
        yield
        os.chdir(request.config.invocation_dir)
    ```

* New: [Checking what package is using a dependency.](python_poetry.md#checking-what-package-is-using-a-dependency)
* New: [Try to use `pass` as a keyring backend to store the PYPI token.](python_poetry.md#configuration)

# DevOps

## Continuous Integration

### [Dependency managers](pip_tools.md)
