# Life Management

## [Life review](life_review.md)

* New: How to review your life.

    Sometimes is good to stop, get into your cave and do an introspection on how is
    your life going.
    
    I like to do this exercise the last week of the year. Although I'd like to do it
    at least twice a year.
    
    This article is the checklist I follow to do my life review, it may seem a lot
    to you or maybe very simple. You can take it as a base or maybe to get some
    ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.
    
    The process then has many phases:
    
    - [Housekeeping](life_review.md#housekeeping)
    - [Analysis](life_review.md#analysis)
    - [Planning](life_review.md#planning)

## [Git](git.md)

* New: [Revert a commit.](git.md#revert-a-commit)

    ```bash
    git revert commit_id
    ```

* New: [Get interesting stats of the repo.](git.md#get-interesting-stats-of-the-repo)

    [Number of commits of the last year per user](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31190474/how-to-count-git-commits-per-user-in-a-date-range):
    
    ```bash
    git shortlog -sne --since="31 Dec 2020" --before="31 Dec 2021"
    ```
    
    You can also use [`git-fame`](https://github.com/casperdcl/git-fame#usage) to
    extract a more detailed report:
    
    ```bash
    $: git-fame --since 1.year --cost hour --loc ins -w -M -C
