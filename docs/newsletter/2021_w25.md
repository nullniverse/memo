    With [pytest-rerunfailures](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-rerunfailures/) that is

    this plugin is generally a bad idea, it would be best to solve the reason why
    your code is not reliable. It's useful when you rely on non robust third party
    software in a way that you can't solve, or if the error is not in your code but
    in the testing code, and again you are not able to fix it.
