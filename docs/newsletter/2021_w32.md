* New: [Introduce pynbox the inbox management tool.](projects.md#pynbox)

    [Pynbox](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox) is a tool to improve the
    management of ideas, tasks, references, suggestions when I'm not in
    front of the computer. Right now I've got Markor for Android to register
    these quicknotes, but the reality is that I don't act upon them, so it's
    just a log of tasks that never get done, and ideas, references and
    suggestions that aren't registered in my knowledge or media management
    systems.
    
    On the computer there are also cases of tasks that are not worth registering in
    the task management system, or ideas that I get at a moment but don't have time
    to process at the moment.
    
    The idea then is to automatically sync the Android quicknote with syncthing,
    and have a special format for the file that allows [`pynbox`](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox)
    to extract
    the elements from that file to the "inbox system". For example:
    +
    ```
    t. buy groceries
    tv. IT crowd
    i. Improve the inbox management
    
    I want a system to improve ...
    ```
    
    Gets introduced in the "inbox system" as a task, a TV suggestion and an idea.

* New: Introduce nyxt as a solution for a better browser.

    I've just stumbled upon [nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/)
    ([code](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt)), and it looks superb.
