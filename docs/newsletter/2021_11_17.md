### [FactoryBoy](factoryboy.md)

* New: [Automatically generate a factory from a pydantic model.](factoryboy.md#automatically-generate-a-factory-from-a-pydantic-model)

    Sadly [it's not yet supported](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/issues/869), [it will at some point though](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/issues/836). If you're interested in following this path, you can start with [mgaitan snippet](https://gist.github.com/mgaitan/dcbe08bf44a5af696f2af752624ac11b) for dataclasses.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Make a flat list of lists with a list comprehension.](python_snippets.md#make-a-flat-list-of-lists-with-a-list-comprehension)

    There is no nice way to do it :(. The best I've found is:
    
    ```python
    t = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]]
    flat_list = [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]
    ```

# DevOps

## Infrastructure Solutions

### [Jobs](kubernetes_jobs.md)

* New: [Manually creating a job from a cronjob.](kubernetes_jobs.md#manually-creating-a-job-from-a-cronjob)

    ```bash
    kubectl create job {{ job_name }} -n {{ namespace }} \
        --from=cronjobs/{{ cronjob_name}}
    ```

## Continuous Integration

### [Pyment](pyment.md)

* New: Introduce Pyment.

    [Pyment](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment) is a python3 program to
    automatically create, update or convert docstrings in existing Python files,
    managing several styles.
    
    As of 2021-11-17, the program is not production ready yet for me, I've tested it
    in one of my projects and found some bugs that needed to be fixed before it's
    usable. Despite the number of stars, it looks like the development pace has
    dropped dramatically, so it needs our help to get better :).
