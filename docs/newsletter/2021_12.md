# Life Management

## [Music Management](music_management.md)

* New: Introduce how I manage my music library.

### [MusicBrainz](musicbrainz.md)

* New: How to contribute to MusicBrainz.

    [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) is an open music encyclopedia that
    collects music metadata and makes it available to the public.
    
    MusicBrainz aims to be:
    
    * The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute and
        releasing the data under open licenses.
    * The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous
        form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have
        meaningful conversations about music.
    
    Like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz is maintained by a global community of users and we
    want everyone — including you — to [participate and contribute](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Contribute).
    

# Coding

## Generic Coding Practices

### [Program Versioning](versioning.md)

* New: Define how to use versioning in software.

    A **long** article on how to use versioning both as a developer and as a consumer. It includes:
    
    * [Deciding what version system to use for your programs](versioning.md#deciding-what-version-system-to-use-for-your-programs).
    * [How to evolve your code version](versioning.md#how-to-evolve-your-code-version).
    * [Deciding how to manage the versions of your dependencies](versioning.md#deciding-how-to-manage-the-versions-of-your-dependencies).
    * A huge rant on [Upper version pinning](versioning.md#upper-version-pinning).
    * [When to use lower version pinning](versioning.md#lower-version-pinning).
    * [How to automatically upgrade and test your dependencies](versioning.md#automatically-upgrade-and-test-your-dependencies).
    * [Monitor your dependencies evolution](versioning.md#monitor-your-dependencies-evolution).
    

### [Keep a Changelog](semantic_versioning.md)

* New: Introduce the Changelog practice.

    A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.
    
    It's purpose is to make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.
    
    In the article we added:
    
    * [Guidelines](changelog.md#changelog-guidelines) on how to build good changelogs
    * [How to reduce the effort required to maintain a changelog](changelog.md#how-to-reduce-the-effort-required-to-maintain-a-changelog)

* New: Introduce Semantic Versioning.

    [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is a way to define your program's version based on the type of changes you've introduced. It's defined as a three-number string (separated with a period) in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
    
    Also included in the article is:
    
    * [When to do a major release](semantic_versioning.md#when-to-do-a-major-release).
    * [Semantic versioning system problems](semantic_versioning.md#semantic-versioning-system-problems).

### [Calendar Versioning](calendar_versioning.md)

* New: Introduce Calendar Versioning.

    [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) is a versioning convention based on
    your project's release calendar, instead of arbitrary numbers.
    
    CalVer suggests version number to be in format of: `YEAR.MONTH.sequence`. For example, `20.1` indicates a release in 2020 January, while `20.5.2` indicates a release that occurred in 2020 May, while the `2` indicates this is the third release of the month.

## Python

### [Pydantic Field Types](pydantic_types.md)

* New: [Using constrained strings in list attributes.](pydantic_types.md#using-constrained-strings-in-list-attributes)

    ```python
    import re
    import pydantic
    from pydantic import Field
    from typing import List
    
    class Regex(pydantic.ConstrainedStr):
        regex = re.compile("^[0-9a-z_]*$")
    
    class Data(pydantic.BaseModel):
        regex: List[Regex]
    
    data = Data(**{"regex": ["abc", "123", "asdf"]})
    print(data)
    print(data.json())
    ```

### [Pipenv](pipenv.md)

* New: Introduce the pipenv package manager.

    [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is a tool that aims to bring the best
    of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the
    Python world.

### [Poetry](python_poetry.md)

* New: Deeply introduce Poetry, a python package manager.

    [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) is a command line program that
    helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of Python projects, ensuring
    you have the right stack everywhere.
    

* New: [Debugging why a package is not updated to the latest version.](python_poetry.md#debugging-why-a-package-is-not-updated-to-the-latest-version)
* New: [Checking what package is using a dependency.](python_poetry.md#checking-what-package-is-using-a-dependency)
* New: [Try to use `pass` as a keyring backend to store the PYPI token.](python_poetry.md#configuration)
* Correction: Warn against upper version pinning.

    The main problem is that `poetry add` does [upper pinning of dependencies](versioning.md#upper-version-pinning) by default, which is a **really bad idea**.

### [Dash](python_sh.md)

* New: [Test programs that use `sh`.](python_sh.md#testing)

    `sh` can be patched in your tests the typical way, with `unittest.mock.patch()`:
    
    ```python
    from unittest.mock import patch
    import sh
    
    def get_something():
        return sh.pwd()
    
    @patch("sh.pwd", create=True)
    def test_something(pwd):
        pwd.return_value = "/"
        assert get_something() == "/"
    ```

### [Code Styling](pydantic_factories.md)

* New: Introduce the awesome, life saving library `pydantic_factories`.

    [Pydantic factories](https://github.com/Goldziher/pydantic-factories) is
    a library offers powerful mock data generation capabilities for pydantic based
    models and dataclasses. It automatically creates [FactoryBoy](factoryboy.md)
    factories from a [pydantic](pydantic.md) model.
    
    ```python
    from datetime import date, datetime
    from typing import List, Union
    
    from pydantic import BaseModel, UUID4
    
    from pydantic_factories import ModelFactory
    
    class Person(BaseModel):
        id: UUID4
        name: str
        hobbies: List[str]
        age: Union[float, int]
        birthday: Union[datetime, date]
    
    class PersonFactory(ModelFactory):
        __model__ = Person
    
    result = PersonFactory.build()
    ```

* Reorganization: Moved the semantic versioning commit guidelines to the semver article.

### [Package Management](python_package_management.md)

* New: Compare Poetry, Pipenv and PDM package management tools.

    Pipenv has broad support. It is an official project of the Python Packaging
    Authority, alongside pip. It's also supported by the Heroku Python buildpack,
    which is useful for anyone with Heroku or Dokku-based deployment strategies.
    
    Poetry is a one-stop shop for dependency management and package management. It
    simplifies creating a package, managing its dependencies, and publishing it.
    Compared to Pipenv, Poetry's separate add and install commands are more
    explicit, and it's faster for everything except for a full dependency install.
    
    I liked Poetry most, and in the end I didn't analyze `pdm`.

* New: [Describe what a dependency solver does.](python_package_management.md#solver)

    A Solver tries to find a working set of dependencies that all agree with each other. By looking back in time, it’s happy to solve very old versions of packages if newer ones are supposed to be incompatible. This can be helpful, but is slow, and also means you can easily get a very ancient set of packages when
    you thought you were getting the latest versions.
    
    In the section we compare Pip's and Poetry's solver.

* New: [Add downsides of Poetry.](python_package_management.md#poetry)

    It does upper version capping by default, which is becoming [a big problem](versioning.md#upper-version-pinning) in the Python environment.
    
    This is specially useless when you add dependencies that follow [CalVer](calendar_versioning.md). `poetry add` packaging will still do `^21` for the version it adds. You shouldn’t be capping versions, but you really shouldn’t be capping CalVer.
    
    It's equally troublesome that it upper pins [the python version](versioning.md#pinning-the-python-version-is-special).

### [GitPython](gitpython.md)

* New: [Clone a repository.](gitpython.md#clone-a-repository)

    ```python
    from git import Repo
    
    Repo.clone_from(git_url, repo_dir)
    ```

* New: [Create a branch.](gitpython.md#create-a-branch)

    ```python
    new_branch = repo.create_head('new_branch')
    assert repo.active_branch != new_branch # It's not checked out yet
    repo.head.reference = new_branch
    assert not repo.head.is_detached
    ```

* New: [Get the latest commit of a repository.](gitpython.md#get-the-latest-commit-of-a-repository)

    ```python
    repo.head.object.hexsha
    ```

### [Pytest](goodconf.md)

* New: Introduce goodconf the pyndantic YAML friendly configuration management.

    [goodconf](https://github.com/lincolnloop/goodconf/) is a thin wrapper over
    Pydantic's settings management. Allows you to define configuration variables and
    load them from environment or JSON/YAML file. Also generates initial
    configuration files and documentation for your defined configuration.

* New: [Capture deprecation warnings.](pytest.md#capture-deprecation-warnings)

    Python and its ecosystem does not have an assumption of strict SemVer, and has a tradition of providing deprecation warnings. If you have good CI, you should be able to catch warnings even before your users see them. Try the following pytest configuration:
    
    ```toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    filterwarnings = ["error"]
    ```
    
    This will turn warnings into errors and allow your CI to break before users break.
    
    Other sections added are:
    
    * [Ensuring code triggers a deprecation warning](pytest.md#ensuring-code-triggers-a-deprecation-warning).
    * [Asserting warnings with the warns function](pytest.md#asserting-warnings-with-the-warns-function).
    * [Recording warnings](pytest.md#recording-warnings).

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Capture the stdout of a function.](python_snippets.md#capture-the-stdout-of-a-function)

    ```python
    import io
    from contextlib import redirect_stdout
    
    f = io.StringIO()
    with redirect_stdout(f):
        do_something(my_object)
    out = f.getvalue()
    ```

* New: [Make temporal directory.](python_snippets.md#make-temporal-directory)

    ```python
    import tempfile
    
    dirpath = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    ```

* New: [Change the working directory of a test.](python_snippets.md#change-the-working-directory-of-a-test)

    ```python
    import unittest
    import os
    
    from src.main import get_cwd
    
    class TestMain(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def test_get_cwd(self):
            os.chdir('src')
            print('testing get_cwd()')
            current_dir = get_cwd()
            self.assertIsNotNone(current_dir)
            self.assertEqual(current_dir, 'src')
    ```

* New: [Copy a directory.](python_snippets.md#copy-a-directory)

    ```python
    import shutil
    
    shutil.copytree('bar', 'foo')
    ```

* Correction: [Use fixture to change the working directory of a test.](python_snippets.md#change-the-working-directory-of-a-test)

    The previous code didn't work, instead use the next fixture:
    
    ```python
    @pytest.fixture(name="change_test_dir")
    def change_test_dir_(request: SubRequest) -> Any:
        os.chdir(request.fspath.dirname)
        yield
        os.chdir(request.config.invocation_dir)
    ```

* New: [IPv4 regular expression.](python_snippets.md#ipv4-regular-expression)

    ```python
    regex = re.compile(
        r"(?<![-\.\d])(?:0{0,2}?[0-9]\.|1\d?\d?\.|2[0-5]?[0-5]?\.){3}"
        r'(?:0{0,2}?[0-9]|1\d?\d?|2[0-5]?[0-5]?)(?![\.\d])"^[0-9]{1,3}*$'
    )
    ```

* New: [Remove the elements of a list from another.](python_snippets.md#remove-the-elements-of-a-list-from-another)

    ```python
    >>> set([1,2,6,8]) - set([2,3,5,8])
    set([1, 6])
    ```

* New: [Change the logging level of a library.](python_snippets.md#change-the-logging-level-of-a-library)

    ```python
    sh_logger = logging.getLogger("sh")
    sh_logger.setLevel(logging.WARN)
    ```

* New: [Get all subdirectories of a directory.](python_snippets.md#get-all-subdirectories-of-a-directory)

    ```python
    [x[0] for x in os.walk(directory)]
    ```

* New: [Move a file.](python_snippets.md#move-a-file)

    ```python
    import os
    
    os.rename("path/to/current/file.foo", "path/to/new/destination/for/file.foo")
    ```

* New: [Copy a file.](python_snippets.md#copy-a-file)

    ```python
    import shutil
    
    shutil.copyfile(src_file, dest_file)
    ```

### [mkdocstrings](docstrings.md)

* New: How to write good test docstrings.

    Both [without a template](docstrings.md#without-template) and using the [Given When Then style](docstrings.md#given-when-then).

### [questionary](questionary.md)

* New: [Conditionally skip questions.](questionary.md#conditionally-skip-questions)

    Sometimes it is helpful to be able to skip a question based on a condition. To
    avoid the need for an if around the question, you can pass the condition when
    you create the question:
    
    ```python
    import questionary
    
    DISABLED = True
    response = questionary.confirm("Are you amazed?").skip_if(DISABLED, default=True).ask()
    ```

* New: [Don't highlight the selected option by default.](questionary.md#don't-highlight-the-selected-option-by-default)

    If you don't want to highlight the default choice in the `select` question use
    the next style:
    
    ```python
    from questionary import Style
    
    choice = select(
        "Question title: ",
        choices=['a', 'b', 'c'],
        default='a',
        style=Style([("selected", "noreverse")]),
    ).ask()
    ```

## [SQLite](sqlite.md)

* New: [Get the columns of a database.](sqlite.md#get-the-columns-of-a-database)

    ```sqlite
    PRAGMA table_info(table_name);
    ```

# DevOps

## Continuous Integration

### [Dependency managers](pip_tools.md)

* Correction: Deprecate in favour of Poetry.

## Automating Processes

### [cruft](cruft.md)

* New: [Monitor the issue to save the cruft config in `pyproject.toml`.](cruft.md#issues)
