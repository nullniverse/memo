## Python

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Explain how to convert html code to readable plaintext.](python_snippets.md#convert-html-to-readable-plaintext)

    ```bash
    pip install html2text
    ```
    
    ```python
    import html2text
    html = open("foobar.html").read()
    print(html2text.html2text(html))
    ```

* New: [Explain how to parse a datetime from a string.](python_snippets.md#parse-a-datetime-from-a-string)

    ```python
    from dateutil import parser
    parser.parse("Aug 28 1999 12:00AM")  # datetime.datetime(1999, 8, 28, 0, 0)
    ```
    

### [Python Mysql](python_mysql.md)

* New: Explain how to interact with MySQL databases with Python.

# DevOps

## [Continuous Integration](ci.md)

* New: Explain how to troubleshoot the error: pathspec master did not match any file.

    Remove all git hooks with `rm -r .git/hooks`.
    

# Software Architecture

## [Domain Driven Design](domain_driven_design.md)

* Improvement: Add warning when migrating old code.

    You may be tempted to migrate all your old code to this architecture once
    you fall in love with it. Truth being told, it's the best way to learn how to
    use it, but it's time expensive too! [The last
    refactor](https://github.com/lyz-code/clinv/pull/40) I did required a
    change of 60% of the code. The upside is that I reduced the total lines of
    code a 25%.
    

# Arts

## Writing

### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: [Explain what collocations are and how to avoid the word very.](orthography.md#use-collocations)

    Collocation refers to a natural combination of words that are closely affiliated
    with each other. They make it easier to avoid overused or ambiguous words like
    "very", "nice", or "beautiful", by using a pair of words that fit the context
    better and that have a more precise meaning.
