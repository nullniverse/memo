# Coding

## Python

### [asyncio](pdm.md)

* New: Add tutorial on how to use asyncio.

    [Roguelynn tutorial](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-we-did-it-wrong/)

* New: Version overriding now supports constrains.

    Before you had to pin specific versions, which is not maintainable, now
    you can use constrains
    
    ```toml
    [tool.pdm.overrides]
    asgiref = ">=3.2.10"
    ```

* New: [Show outdated packages.](pdm.md#show-outdated-packages)

    ```bash
    pdm update --dry-run --unconstrained
    ```

### [Pydantic Factories](pydantic_factories.md)

* Correction: Correct the type hints of the factory.

    Use `Any`
    
    ```python
    class PersonFactory(ModelFactory[Any]):
        ...
    ```

* New: [Track issue when using with.](pydantic_factories.md#issues)

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Resolve the 307 error.](fastapi.md#resolve-the-307-error)

    Probably you've introduced an ending `/` to the endpoint, so instead of asking
    for `/my/endpoint` you tried to do `/my/endpoint/`.

### [Feedparser](feedparser.md)

* New: [Add issue when using `updated_parser`.](feedparser.md#issues)

    [Deprecation warning when using `updated_parsed`](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/issues/151)

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* Correction: Update the tmpdir_factory type hints.

    You should now use `TempPathFactory` instead of `TempdirFactory`

* Correction: [Use `pytest-freezegun` globally.](pytest.md#global-usage)

    [Most of the tests](https://medium.com/@boxed/flaky-tests-part-3-freeze-the-world-e4929a0da00e)
    work with frozen time, so it's better to freeze it by default and unfreeze it on
    the ones that actually need time to move.
    
    To do that set in your `tests/conftest.py` a globally used fixture:
    
    ```python
    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        from freezegun.api import FrozenDateTimeFactory
    
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def frozen_time() -> Generator['FrozenDateTimeFactory', None, None]:
        """Freeze all tests time"""
        with freezegun.freeze_time() as freeze:
            yield freeze
    ```

* New: Ignore a warning of a specific package.

    In the `pyproject.toml`
    
    ```toml
    filterwarnings = [
      "error",
      # Until https://github.com/ktosiek/pytest-freezegun/issues/35 is merged
      "ignore::DeprecationWarning:pytest_freezegun.*"
    ]
    ```

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [How to raise a warning.](python_snippets.md#how-to-raise-a-warning)

    Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert
    the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesnâ€™t
    warrant raising an exception and terminating the program. For example, one might
    want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.
    
    ```python
    import warnings
    
    def f():
        warnings.warn('Message', DeprecationWarning)
    ```
    
    To test the function with pytest you can use
    [`pytest.warns`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html#warns):
    
    ```python
    import warnings
    import pytest
    
    def test_warning():
        with pytest.warns(UserWarning, match='my warning'):
            warnings.warn("my warning", UserWarning)
    ```

* New: [Parse XML file with beautifulsoup.](python_snippets.md#parse-xml-file-with-beautifulsoup)

    You need both `beautifulsoup4` and `lxml`:
    
    ```python
    bs = BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url), "lxml")
    ```

* New: [Get a traceback from an exception.](python_snippets.md#get-a-traceback-from-an-exception)

    ```python
    import traceback
    
    traceback_str = ''.join(traceback.format_tb(e.__traceback__))
    ```

# DevOps

## Continuous Integration

### [Flakeheaven](flakeheaven.md)

* New: Deprecate flakeheaven in favour of flakeheaven.

    It's a fork maintained by the community, instead of an absent code
    dictator.
