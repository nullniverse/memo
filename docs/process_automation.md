I understand process automation as the act of analyzing yourself and your
interactions with the world to find the way to reduce the time or willpower
spent on your life processes.

Once you've covered some minimum life requirements (health, money or
happiness), time is your most valued asset. It's sad to waste it doing stuff
that we need but don't increase our happiness.

I've also faced the problem of having so much stuff in my mind. Having
background processes increase your brain load and are a constant sink of
willpower. As a result, when you really need that CPU time, your brain is tired
and doesn't work to it's full performance. Automating processes, as well as life
logging and task management, allows you to delegate those worries.

Process automation can lead to [habit
building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit), which reduces even more the
willpower consumption of processes, at the same time it reduces the error rate.

The marvelous [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com) has gathered the essence and
pitfalls of process automation many times:
