As a privacy minded human, I try to avoid using proprietary software and
services as much as possible. Map management is not an exception. Google maps is
monopolizing mapping and routing, but there are better alternatives out there.

For navigating on the go, I strongly recommend [OSMand+](osmand.md), for
browsing maps in the browser, use [OpenStreetMaps](https://osm.org) or
[CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org) if you want to move by bike.

To plan routes, you can use [brouter.de](https://brouter.de/brouter-web), it
works perfectly for bikes. For hiking is awesome too, it shows you a lot of data
needed to plan your tracks (check the settings on the right). If you want to
invest a little more time, you can even set your [personalize
profiles](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki/Hiking-profiles), so
that the routing algorithm prioritizes the routes to your desires. It's based on
[brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and both can be
[self-hosted](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web), although [brouter does
not yet use Docker](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter/issues/359).
