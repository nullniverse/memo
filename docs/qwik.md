[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io) is a new kind of web framework that can deliver
instantly load web applications at any size or complexity. Your sites and apps
can boot with about 1kb of JS (regardless of application complexity), and
achieve consistent performance at scale.

You can see a good overview in the [Qwik
