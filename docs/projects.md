There is an ever growing pool of ideas where I want to invest my time. Sadly
time is a finite currency, and even though I am lucky enough to be able to put
my focus on maximizing it, it's never enough.

I understand projects as a mental tool that groups ideas, processes and tools to
achieve a specific goal. Following the [digital garden](digital_garden.md)
metaphor, projects are plants in different phases of development where I've
spent a different amount of effort.

The development phases are:

* [*Seeds*](#seeds): Are raw, basic ideas of projects that may once be.

* [*Seedlings*](#seedlings): Are projects that don't yet have their first stable version, but
    the drafts of the [ADR](adr.md) and some code is already written.

* [*Growing*](#growing-plants): Projects that have a stable release and are
    under active development.

* [*Dormant*](#dormant-plants): Projects whose growth has temporally stopped.
    I still believe they are useful and even though I don't want to work on them
    at the moment, I see myself doing it in the future.

    I still maintain them by answering to issues, reviewing pull requests,
    keeping the continuous integration pipelines alive and developing fixes to
    important issues.

* [*Dying*](#dying-plants): Projects that I know are going to be deprecated
    soon, and I'm looking for alternatives.

* *Dead*: Project no longer used.

# Growing plants

## [Blue book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/)

What you're reading right now. I'm storing most of the new knowledge I learn
every day. At the same time I'm migrating the notes of the previous
version of this digital garden which consists on 7422 articles, almost 50
million lines.

## [Repository ORM](https://lyz-code.github.io/repository-orm)

I'm creating a [Python library](https://github.com/lyz-code/repository-orm)
to make it easier to use the [repository pattern](repository_pattern.md) in new
projects.

I monthly spin up new ideas for programs, and managing the storage of the
information is cumbersome and repeating. My idea is to refactor that common
codebase into a generic library that anyone can use.

## [Pynbox](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox)

I wanted a system to improve the management of ideas, tasks,
references, suggestions when I'm not in front of the computer. Right now I've
got Markor for Android to register these quicknotes, but the reality is that
I don't act upon them, so it's just a log of tasks that never get done, and
ideas, references and suggestions that aren't registered in my knowledge or
media management systems.

On the computer there are also cases of tasks that are not worth registering in
the task management system, or ideas that I get at a moment but don't have time
to process at the moment.

The idea then is to automatically sync the Android quicknote with syncthing,
and have a special format for the file that allows `pynbox`
to extract
the elements from that file to the "inbox system". For example:

```
t. buy groceries
tv. IT crowd
i. Improve the inbox management

I want a system to improve ...
```

Gets introduced in the "inbox system" as a task, a TV suggestion and an idea.

# Dormant Plants

## [mkdocs-newsletter](https://lyz-code.github.io/mkdocs-newsletter/)

MkDocs plugin to show the changes of documentation repositories in a user
friendly format, at the same time that it's easy for the authors to maintain.

It creates daily, weekly, monthly and yearly newsletter articles with the
changes of each period. Those pages, stored under the `Newsletters` section, are
filled with the changes extracted from the commit messages of the git history.
The changes are grouped by categories, subcategories and then by file using the
order of the site's navigation structure. RSS feeds are also created for each
newsletter type, so it's easy for people to keep updated with the evolution of
the site.

I use it for this site
[newsletters](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/newsletter/0_newsletter_index/).

## [Autoimport](https://lyz-code.github.io/autoimport/)

Throughout the development of a python program you continuously need to manage
the python import statements either because you need one new object or because
you no longer need it. This means that you need to stop writing whatever you
were writing, go to the top of the file, create or remove the import statement
and then resume coding.

This workflow break is annoying and almost always unnecessary.
[autoimport](https://lyz-code.github.io/autoimport/) solves this problem if you
execute it whenever you have an import error, for example by configuring your
editor to run it when saving the file.

The reasons why it is dormant are:

* The current features cover most of needs. Even though I'd like to be able to
    [import broken package
    objects](https://github.com/lyz-code/autoimport/issues/74), and that it is
    intelligent enough to use [relative
    imports](https://github.com/lyz-code/autoimport/issues/75).
* My hype is elsewhere.

## [Clinv](https://github.com/lyz-code/clinv)

As part of my [DevSecOps](https://dzone.com/articles/shifting-left-devsecops)
work, I need to have an updated inventory of cloud assets organized under a risk
management framework.

As you can see in [how do you document your
infrastructure?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/dxmkci/how_do_you_document_your_infrastructure/),
there is still a void on how to maintain an inventory of dynamic resources with
a DevSecOps point of view.

* Manage a dynamic inventory of risk management resources (Projects, Services,
  Information, People) and infrastructure resources (EC2, RDS, S3, Route53, IAM
  users, IAM groups…).
* Add risk management metadata to your AWS resources.
* Monitor if there are resources that are not inside your inventory.
* Perform regular expression searches on all your resources.
* Get all your resources information.
* Works from the command line.

So I started building [clinv](https://github.com/lyz-code/clinv).

## [yamlfix](https://lyz-code.github.io/yamlfix)

A simple opinionated yaml formatter that keeps your comments.

The reasons why it is dormant are:

* The current features cover most of needs.
* My hype is elsewhere.

## [bruty](https://github.com/lyz-code/bruty)

Python program to bruteforce dynamic web applications with Selenium.

## [Cookiecutter Python template](https://lyz-code.github.io/cookiecutter-python-project/)

Following the same reasoning as the previous section, I've spent a lot of time
investigating quality measures for python projects, such as project structure, ci
testing, ci building, dependency management, beautiful docs or pre-commits. With
the [cookiecutter
template](https://github.com/lyz-code/cookiecutter-python-project), it is easy
to create a new project with the best quality measures with zero effort.
Furthermore, with [cruft](cruft.md) I can keep all the projects generated with
the template updated with the best practices.

## Mediarss

I've always wanted to own the music I listen, because I don't want to give my
data to the companies host the streaming services, nor I trust that they'll
keep on giving the service.

So I started building some small bash scrappers (I wasn't yet introduced to
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)) to
get the media. That's when I learned to hate the web developers for their
constant changes and to love the API.

Then I discovered [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), a Python
command-line program to download video or music from streaming sites. But
I still laked the ability to stay updated with the artist channels.

So mediarss was born. A youtube-dl wrapper to periodically download new
content.

This way, instead of using Youtube, Soundcloud or Bandcamp subscriptions, I've got
a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) with all the links that I want to
monitor.

## Playlist_generator

When my music library started growing due to [mediarss](#mediarss), I wanted
to generate playlists filtering my content by:

* Rating score fetched with [mep](#mep).
* First time/last listened.
* Never listened songs.

The playlists I usually generate with these filters are:

* Random unheard songs.
* Songs discovered last month/year with a rating score greater than X.
* Songs that I haven't heard since 20XX  with a rating score greater than
  X (this one gave me pleasant surprises ^^).

## Media indexation

I've got a music collection of more than 136362 songs, belonging to
[mediarss](#mediarss) downloads, bought CDs rips and friend library sharing. It
is more less organized in a directory tree by genre, but I lack any library
management features. I've got a lot of duplicates, incoherent naming scheme, no
way of filtering or intelligent playlist generation.

[playlist_generator](#playlist_generator) helped me with the last point, based
on the metadata gathered with [mep](#mep), but it's still not enough.

So I'm in my way of migrate all the library to
[beets](http://beets.readthedocs.io/), and then I'll deprecate [mep](#mep) in
favor to a [mpd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon) client that
allows me to keep on saving the same metadata.

Once it's implemented, I'll migrate all the metadata to the new system.

## Home Stock inventory

I try to follow the idea of emptying my mind as much as possible, so I'm able to
spend my CPU time wisely.

Keeping track of what do you have at home or what needs to be bought is an
effort that should be avoided.

So I've integrated [Grocy](https://grocy.info/) in my life.

## [Drode](https://lyz-code.github.io/drode/)

[drode](https://lyz-code.github.io/drode/) is a wrapper over the Drone and AWS
APIs to make deployments more user friendly.

It assumes that the projects are configured to continuous deliver all master
commits to staging. Then those commits can be promoted to production or to
staging for upgrades and rollbacks.

It has the following features:

* Prevent failed jobs to be promoted to production.
* Promote jobs with less arguments than the drone command line.
* Wait for a drone build to end, then raise the terminal bell.

## [Create an ordered list of digital gardens](https://github.com/lyz-code/best-of-digital-gardens)

A [best-of-lists](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of) compilation of
awesome list of digital gardens.

# Seedlings

## [Learn about antifascism](antifascism.md)

I'm summing up the key insights of
[Mark's](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/antifa/) and
[Pol's](https://www.txalaparta.eus/es/libros/todo-el-mundo-puede-ser-antifa)
awesome books in [this article](antifascism.md)

## [Automate email management](email_management.md)

Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated,
in the [Email management](email_management.md) article I'm gathering the steps
to setup such an infrastructure.

## [Learn about sleep](sleep.md)

I'm reading Matthew Walker's awesome book [Why we
sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) and summing up
the key insights in [this article](sleep.md)

## [Life](https://lyz-code.github.io/life/)

Life is a real time sandbox role game where you play as yourself surviving in today's
world.

## Self hosted map

I love maps, as well as traveling and hiking. This project aims to create a web
interface that let's me interact with the data gathered throughout my life. I'd
like to:

* Browse the waypoints and routes that I've done.
* Create routes and export the gpx.
* Be able to search through the data
* Plan trips

All the data must live in my servers.

I first started with [umap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) but it stopped
being responsive when you add many points, and it's not easy to self-host. Then
I went with [folium](folium.md), but it lacked the interactively I wanted, so
I ended up using [dash leaflet](dash_leaflet.md).

The first phase of the project is to be able to import and browse the existing
data. A second phase will be to add the [routing
functionality](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing/online_routers),
maybe with [Leaflet Routing
Machine](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/#getting-started), which
will probably need a [self-hosted OSRM
server](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Running-OSRM).
Meanwhile I'm using the [brouter-web](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) that uses
[brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) behind the scenes.

# Seeds

This is a gathering of tools, ideas or services that I'd like to enjoy.

If you have any lead, as smallest as it may be on how to fulfill them, please
[contact me](contact.md).

## Beancount forecast

I'd like to see a forecast of the evolution of my accounts given an amount of
time. Maybe by doing seasonality analysis and forecast in time series as stated
[here](https://medium.com/swlh/seasonality-analysis-and-forecast-in-time-series-b8fbba820327)
and
[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-seasonal-trends-in-time-series-data-with-python-ce10c37aa861).

It will also be interesting to see for a given account the evolution of the
subaccounts.

## Life warnings

I've always tackled the pursuit of the peace of mind by improving in task
management, for example trying to predict when I have to do something in order
to avoid a nuisance. Maybe it's more interesting to monitor and visibilice the
warnings that are affecting you.

Once a warning is active you need to keep track of its evolve throughout time
maybe with a simple [questionary](questionary.md). This track could be both
quantitative (bother level from 1 to 10), and qualitative (a description of the
state and evolution).

The user will have a view (probably command line interface) of the active
warnings, their priority, bother level, bother level change, last update, number
of days it's been active, predicted end. Another interesting view can be the
evolution of solved warnings and new warnings.

Warnings are not completely solved, as they can happen again. That way we can
see how often do they reactivate, and maybe we can get an estimate of the next
occurrence. It can also be interesting to see how long did the last warnings
last and the effectiveness of the different actions taken to solve it.

We'll need an easy way to filter and merge warnings so as not to repeat similar
ones. I think it's better to prioritize tags over categories to avoid hierarchy
problems. For example, we can track a headache with the tags `health` and
`head`.

The activation/deactivation of warnings will change with the warning type:

* Manual: User triggers the state change through the program's command line
* Script: A python or bash script that automatically gathers the data and
    decides if the warning is still active or inactive.

    This method can give a huge boost in the motivation of self logging through
    [quantified self](#quantified-self).

## Pomodoro command line

Command line to help with the [pomodoro workflow](task_workflows.md#pomodoro), besides the basic stuff it will
interact with the task manager, [activitywatch](activitywatch.md) and the
notifications system so that:

* If you are in focus mode, the notifications will be deactivated, once the
    pomodoro cycle ends, the notifications will show up.
* If you are in focus mode, and you check the notification applications,
    a notification warning will be shown.
* As you'll check the notification systems between pomodoro cycles, unless you
    start the pomodoro cycle in focus mode, it's assumed that you may need to
    interact with them, but if X amount of minutes has passed since the start of
    the cycle and you haven't seen them, then it's assumed that you are in focus
    mode, and therefore the notifications will be deactivated.
* When you start a pomodoro cycle it will let you activate one of the task
    manager tasks, so it will track the time spent in that task. If you change
    the window manager focus to a window that is not related to the task at hand
    it will stop recording and show you a warning.

## Version Update Manager

Keeping software updated is not easy because:

* There are many technologies involved: package managers (apt, yum, pip, yarn,
    npm, ...), programming languages (python, java, ruby, ...), operative
    systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ...), deployment technologies (OS install, Docker,
    Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm), template software (cruft).
* Each software maintainers use a different version system.
* Even a small increase in a version may break everything.
* Sometimes only the latest version is the supported version.
* It's not easy to check if the update went well.
* You not only need the desired package to be updated, but also it's
    dependencies.

I'd like to find a solution that:

* Gives an overall insight of the update status of a system.
* Automates the update process.
* Support both single system installation or aggregator of multiple systems.

## Shared accounting

I use [beancount](beancount.md) for my personal accounting, I'd like to have
a system that integrates more less easily with beancount and let's do a shared
accounting with other people, for example in trips. I've used [settle
up](https://settleup.io/) in the past but it requires access to their servers,
and an account linked to google, facebook or one you register in their servers.

I've looked at [facto](https://github.com/nymanjens/facto) but it uses a logic
that doesn't apply to my case, it does a heavy use on a common account, instead
of minimizing the transactions between the people. I also tried
[tabby](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby#installation), even though they
still [don't support Docker](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby/issues/13),
but it doesn't suit my case either :(.

Until a new solution shows up, I'll go with [Tricky
Tripper](https://github.com/koelleChristian/trickytripper) available in F-Droid,
and manage the expenses myself and periodically send the html reports to the
rest of the group.

## Improve the reliability of the Open Science collections

The current [free knowledge efforts](free_knowledge.md) are based on the health
of a collection of torrents.

Something that is needed is a command line tool that reads the [list of ill
torrents](https://phillm.net/torrent-health-frontend/seeds-needed.php), and
downloads the ones that have a low number of seeders and DHT peers. The
number of torrents to download could be limited by the amount the user wants to
share. A second version could have an interaction with the torrent client so
that when a torrent is no longer ill, it's automatically replaced with one that
is.

Once the tool is built:

* Update the [Free knowledge post](free_knowledge.md).
* Promote the tool in the relevant reddit posts
    [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/nc27fv/rescue_mission_for_scihub_and_open_science_we_are/)
    and
    [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ed9byj/library_genesis_project_update_25_million_books/),
    try to add it to the [freeread.org wiki](https://freeread.org/torrents/)
    ([source](https://github.com/freereadorg/freeread)), and to the
    [awesome-libgen list](https://github.com/freereadorg/awesome-libgen).

## Monitor and notify on disk prices

[Diskprices.com](https://diskprices.com/) sorts the prices of the disks on the
different amazon sites based on many filters. It will be interesting to have
a service that monitors the data on this site and alerts the user once there is
a deal that matches its criteria.

Once it's done, promote it in the [DataHoarder
reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/).

## Switch to a better browser

Firefox + Trydactil has it's limits, and Firefox has been following an ill path
for a while, [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) looks
like the perfect replacement.

I've just stumbled upon [nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/)
([code](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt)), and it looks superb.

## Automating computer file management

Today I've stumbled upon [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
looks good for automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it
with [inotifywait](https://askubuntu.com/a/819290) instead of with a [cron
job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).

## Self hosted search engine

It would be awesome to be able to self host a personal search engine that
performs prioritized queries in the data sources that I choose.

This idea comes from me getting tired of:

* Forgetting to search in my gathered knowledge before going to the internet.
* Not being able to prioritize known trusted sources.

Some sources I'd like to query:

* Markdown brains, like my blue and red books.
* Awesome lists.
* My browsing history.
* Blogs.
* [learn-anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).
* [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).
* [themoviedb](https://themoviedb.org).
* [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com)
* [Reddit](https://reddit.com).
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
* [Startpage](https://startpage.com).

Each source should be added as a plugin to let people develop their own.

I'd also like to be able to rate in my browsing the web pages so they get more
relevance in future searches. That rating can also influence the order of the
different sources.

It will archive the rated websites to avoid [link
rot](https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot) maybe with
[ipwb](https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb).

If we use a knowledge graph, we could federate to ask other nodes and help
discover or prioritize content.

The browsing could be related with knowledge graph tags.

We can also have integration with Anki after a search is done.

A possible architecture could be:

* A flask + Reactjs frontend.
* An elasticsearch instance for persistence.
* A Neo4j or knowledge graph to get relations.

It must be open sourced and Linux compatible. And it would be awesome if
I didn't have to learn how to use another editor.

Maybe [meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch) (follow their
[blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/)) or
[searx](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx) could be a solution. Following
another approach, [archivy](https://archivy.github.io/) looks good too.

Or I could use [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) is a search library
linked to pydantic, or maybe
[quickwit](https://github.com/quickwit-inc/quickwit) if they're more stable and
mature than right now.

If I've already started the [quantified self](#quantified-self) project, maybe
[adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex)  is a good solution.

## Quantified self

I've been gathering data about myself for a long time, but I don't have
a centralized solution that lets me extract information.

There are already good solutions to start with, being the best
[HPI](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html):

* [bionic](https://github.com/bionic-dev/bionic) or [their explanations on how to
export data](https://github.com/bionic-dev/how-to-export-personal-data) can be
useful too.

* [rsarai hq](https://github.com/rsarai/hq)

For the interface [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks awesome!
It's inspired in the Andrew Louis [talk Building
a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s) whose [blog
posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seems to be a gold mine.

Also look at [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi) and the
[awesome-quantified-self](https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self)
resources.

## Improve the way of launching applications with i3wm

In the past I tried installing [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
without success, I should try again. If the default features are not enough,
check [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

## Improve the notification management in Linux

I want to be able to group and silence the notifications under a custom logic.
For example:

* If I want to focus on a task, only show the most important ones.
* Only show alerts once every X minutes. Or define that I want to receive them
    the first 10 minutes of every hour.
* If I'm not working, silence all work alerts.

From what I see [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) notification manager
supports rules and filters, if it's not powerful enough, I may use it with
a custom script that uses [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise).

Check [Archlinux dunst wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dunst) and the [source
code](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) too.

## Improve the hard drive monitor system

Use something like [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) (there's
a [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-scrutiny)) to
collect and display the information. For alerts, use one of their [supported
providers](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny#notifications).

## Improve the periodic tasks and application metrics monitoring

Setup an [healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) instance with the [linuxserver
image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-healthchecks) to monitor
cronjobs.

For the notifications either use the [prometheus
metrics](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_prometheus/) or an
[apprise](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks/issues/271) compatible
system.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks).

## Aggregate all notifications

Instead of reading the email, github, gitlab, discourse, reddit notifications,
aggregate all in one place and show them to the user in a nice command line
interface.

For the aggregator server, my first choice would be
[gotify](https://gotify.net/).

## Decentralized encrypted end to end VOIP and video software

I'd like to be able to make phone and video calls keeping in mind that:

* Every connection must be encrypted end to end.
* I trust the security of a linux server more than a user device. This rules out
  distributed solutions such as [tox](https://tox.chat/) that exposes the client
  IP in a DHT table.
* The server solution should be self hosted.
* It must use tested cryptography, which again rolls out tox.

These are the candidates I've found:

* [Riot](https://about.riot.im/). You'll need to host your own [Synapse
  server](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse).
* [Jami](https://jami.net). I think it can be configured as decentralized if you
  host your own DHTproxy, bootstrap and nameserver, but I need to delve further
  into [how it makes
  a call](https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/2.4.%20Let's%20do%20a%20call).
  I'm not sure, but you'll probably need to use [push
  notifications](https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/tutorials/Frequently-Asked-Questions#advanced-3)
  so as not to expose a service from the user device.
* [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org). If we host our
  [Flexisip](https://www.linphone.org/flexisip-server) server, although it asks
  for a lot of permissions.

[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) it's not an option as it's not [end
to end encrypted](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/409). But if you
want to use it, please use [Disroot service](https://call.disroot.org) or host
your own.

## Self hosted voice assistant

Host a [virtual assistant](virtual_assistant.md) in my servers to help me
automate repetitive stuff.

For offline voice recognition, [vosk-api](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api)
can be used. Or [voiceliner](https://github.com/maxkrieger/voiceliner/issues/37)
once it supports offline voice recognition.

## Others

* A tool or service to follow the updates of software, right now I subscribe to
    the releases of the github repositories, but I'd like it to be provider
    agnostic, and cleaner than the emails github sends.
* Movie/serie/music rating self hosted solution that based on your ratings
  discovers new content.
* Hiking route classifier and rating self hosted web application.
* A command line friendly personal CRM like
    [Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica) that is able to
    [register the time length and rating of
    interactions](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/4186) to do data
    analysis on my relations.
* Digital e-ink note taking system that is affordable, self hosted and performs
  character recognition.
* A git issue tracker that keeps the context of why I subscribed to them. Until
    I find one, I'll use the [issues](issues.md#vim-workflow-improvements) document.
* An easy way of creating markdown links to other file's sections. Similar to
    [mkdx](https://github.com/SidOfc/mkdx#insert-mode-fragment-completion)
    functionality. I tried using it but it didn't work for me, and I don't know

## mep

I started  [life logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog) with `mep`. One
of the first programs I wrote when learning
[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29).

It is a [mplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer) wrapper that allows me
to control it with [i3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I3_%28window_manager%29)
key bindings and store metadata of the music I listen.

I don't even publish it because it's a horrible program that would make your
eyes bleed. 600 lines of code, only 3 functions, 6 levels of nested ifs, no
tests at all, but hey, the functions have docstrings! `(ｏ・_・)ノ”(ᴗ_ ᴗ。)`

The thing is that it works, so I everyday close my eyes and open my ears,
waiting for a solution that gives me the same features with
[mpd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon).

## [faker-optional](https://lyz-code.github.io/faker-optional/)

Wrapper over other Faker providers to return their value or `None`. Useful to
create data of type `Optional[Any]`.

Not needed anymore as I use [pydantic factories](pydantic_factories.md) now.
