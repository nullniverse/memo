Bad grammar can thwart communication. It's especially important in today's world
where we don't have the chance to have in person interactions or when your words
might reach a wide audience. The quality of your text will impact how your
message reaches people.

This article is an effort to gather all my common pitfalls.

# Use of z or s in some words

It looks like American english uses `z` while British uses `s`, some examples:

* [Organizations vs
    organisation](https://writingexplained.org/organisation-vs-organization-difference).
* [Authorization vs
    authorisation](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/282621/authorization-vs-authorisation-im-in-some-real-dilemma).
* [Customized vs
    customised](https://grammarist.com/spelling/customise-customize/).

Both forms are correct, so choose the one that suits your liking.

# [Stop saying "I know"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjvpR02uNg)

Using "I know" may not be the best way to show the other person that you've
received the information. You can take the chance to use other words that
additionally gives more context on how you stand with the information you've
received, thus improving the communication and creating a bond. Each of the next
words carries a different nuance:

* `Recognize`: You acknowledge the truth, existence or validity of the
    information.

* `From my perspective`: You're showing that given the information, you see the
    person's point and state that you have a different one.

* `Appreciate`: You recognize the implications and true value of the subject and
    are being thankful for the information.

* `Understand`: You show that you've perceived the underlying meaning of the
    information. It implies a deeper level of information processing.

* `I see`: You show that you understand and that you're paying all your
    attention.

Besides showing where you stand or how you feel, you can use other phrases that
make connection at the visual, audio and kinesthetic levels to improve the
communication.

* `I hear what you're saying`: Shows auditory connection.
* `I get the picture` or `I see what you mean`: Shows visual connection.
* `I catch your drift`: Shows kinesthetic connection.

You can also add information when saying that you don't know. For example you
can use:

* `Misread`: You give the idea that you perceived the information wrong.
* `Misunderstood`: You perceived the information well, but formed the wrong idea
    in your head.
* `Mixed up`: You had the correct information and idea, but you ended up saying
    or doing the wrong answer.
* `Confused`: You have the correct information but you can't form a clear idea.

# [Use collocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_collocations)

Collocation refers to a natural combination of words that are closely affiliated
with each other. They make it easier to avoid overused or ambiguous words like
"very", "nice", or "beautiful", by using a pair of words that fit the context
better and that have a more precise meaning. Skilled users of the language can
produce effects such as humor by varying the normal patterns of collocation.

# [I'm good or I'm well](https://thegrammargeekblog.wordpress.com/2019/05/27/im-good-or-im-well/)

!!! note "TL;DR"
    Use I'm well when referring to being ill, use I'm good for the rest.

`Good` is an adjective. `Well` is usually an adverb, but it can also act as
an adjective.

Adjectives modify nouns. When you say you're having a good day, the adjective
`good` modifies the noun `day`.

When people say `I'm good`, they're using `good` to modify `I`. Because `I` is
a noun, this use of `good` is correct. The confusion comes when using the verb
`am`, which makes people think we need an adverb. For example, you might say, `I
play the piano poorly`. The adverb `poorly` is modifying the verb `play`, so
that sentence is correct.

But the sentence `I'm good`', `good` is modifying `I`, it's not modifying `am`,
so `good` is correct, and `well` is not.

`Well` is an adverb, they are here to modify verbs, adjectives or other adverbs.
You might say `I play the piano well`. Here `well` changes the verb `play`.
However, `well` can also be an adjective, usually to describe someone who is in
good health. So when some one says `I'm well`, they're using `well` as an
adjective modifying `I`.

# [Won't vs Wont](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/wont-vs-wont/)

* Won't is the correct way to contract will not.
* Wont is a synonym of "a habit". For example, "He went for a morning jog, as was
    his wont".

# [How to use the singular they](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they)

The singular “they” is a generic third-person pronoun used in English.

When readers see a gendered pronoun, such as he or she, they make assumptions
about the gender of the person being described. It's better to use the singular
“they” because it is inclusive of all people and helps writers avoid making
assumptions about gender.

You should use it in these cases:

* When referring to a generic person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context and
* When referring to a specific, known person who uses “they” as their pronoun.

When “they” is the subject of a sentence, “they” takes a plural verb regardless
of whether “they” is meant to be singular or plural.  For example, write “they
are” not “they is”. The singular “they” works similarly to the singular
“you”, even though “you” may refer to one person or multiple people. However, if
the noun in one sentence is a word like “individual” or a person’s name, use
a singular verb.

# Where to add your pronouns

The correct place to add your pronouns is after you present yourself, such as:

> Hi, I’m Lyz (he/him), I'm writing to tell you…

# [When to capitalize after a question mark](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/25152/does-the-word-after-a-question-mark-start-with-a-capital-letter)

!!! note "TL;DR"

    If the sentence ends after the question mark you should capitalize, if it
    doesn't end, you shouldn't have used the question mark, since it ends
    a sentence.

The capitalization rule that we care about here is that the first word of
a sentence starts with a capital letter, so the question is really about what
ends a sentence. The answer to that is easy: terminal punctuation, i.e. a full
stop, question mark or exclamation mark. There's a visual clue in that `?` and
`!` are decorated full stops; you just have to remember that a colon (`:`) isn't
really a decorated full stop, not that you'd ever know by looking at it. Colons,
semicolons and commas aren't terminal punctuation, so they don't end a sentence
and so don't force the next letter to be a capital. It may be a capital letter
for some other reason such as being the start of a proper name, but not because
it is starting a sentence.

There are exceptions to this rule, occasions when `?` and `!` become
non terminal punctuation. The most obvious is in quoted speech: if the speaker
asks a question or makes an exclamation, the `?` or `!` doesn't have to be
terminal if the sentence carries on after the quote.

> "Should I write it like this?" he asked. "Or perhaps like this?"

The other class of exception is for what are probably really parenthetical
comments. If you have a short phrase that you could have put aside in
parentheses or dashes, then a question mark or exclamation mark can be used at
the end of that phrase without ending the sentence. Be sparing with this. It
looks wrong at a first read.

> Should I write it like this, or abracadabra! like this?

When joining many questions you might may have the doubt of which of the
following is correct:

> Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this?
> Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this?
> Should I write it like this, or perhaps like that?
> "Should I write it like this?" he asked, "or perhaps like that?"

The second with the lowercase `or` is just plain wrong.

Crusty old grammarians who disapprove of starting sentences with conjunctions
may frown at example 1 all they like, but it's a perfectly acceptable
fragmentary sentence. Whether it's the right answer or not is another question
entirely. Example 1 makes the point that the questions are distinct, though they
are strongly linked otherwise the whole structure wouldn't work.

Example 3 on the other hand emphasizes that the two questions are options in
a common situation, as well as reflecting a different way of saying them. That
is clear in this case because the two questions are tightly coupled
alternatives. However, consider the following:

> Are the lights green? Or is the switch up?
> Are the lights green, or is the switch up?

Both of these examples imply that the state of the lights and the state of the
switch are related somehow. Version 2 couples them more tightly; I would usually
assume (without more context) that either this is the same question being asked
in two different ways (i.e. that the switch being up should cause the lights to
be green), or that they are an exhaustive list of possibilities (either the
switch is up or the lights are green, but not both or neither). This isn't an
absolute rule, but it's quite strongly implied.

Example 4 is also wrong, though it has a better disguise. If you unwrap the
quotes, what you get is:

> Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this?

Which is example 2 back again. What you actually want is one of:

> "Should I write it like this?" he asked. "Or perhaps like this?" (i.e. example 1)
> "Should I write it like this," he asked, "or perhaps like that? (i.e. example 3)

Exclamation marks work like question marks for this purpose. Semicolons don't;
they end a clause, not a sentence.

# [When to write Apostrophes before an s](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/apostrophe/)

* For most singular nouns, add `apostrophe + s`: *The writer's desk*.
* For most plural nouns, add `apostrophe`: *The writers' desk* (multiple writers).
* For plural nouns that do not end in s, add `apostrophe + s`: *The geese's
    migration route*.
* For singular proper nouns both `apostrophe` and `apostrophe + s` is accepted,
    but as the plural proper nouns ending in s, the correct form is `apostrophe`
    I'd use that for both, so: *Charles Dickens' novels* and *The
    Smiths' vacation*.

The personal pronouns, do *not* have apostrophes to form possessives, such as
your, yours, hers, its, ours, their, whose, and theirs. In
fact, for some of these pronouns, adding an apostrophe forms a contraction
instead of a possessive.

# Who vs Whom

If you can replace the word with *she* or *he*, use *who*. If you can replace it
with *her* or *him*, use *whom*.

* *Who*: Should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence.
* *Whom*: Should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.

# [A vs An](https://www.grammar.com/a-vs-an-when-to-use/)

We were all taught that *a* precedes a word starting with a consonant and that
*an* precedes a word starting with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y). But
what matters is the sound of the letter beginning the word, not just the letter
itself. The way we say the word will determine whether or not we use *a* or
*an*.

If the word begins with a vowel sound, you must use *an*. If it begins with
a consonant sound, you must use *a*.

# [Comma before and](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma-before-and/)

There are two cases:

* It's required to put a comma before and when it’s connecting two independent clauses.
* It’s [almost always
    optional](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/)
    the use of comma before and in lists. This case is also known as *serial
    commas* or *Oxford commas*.

Since in some cases is useful, I'm going to use them to reduce the mental load.

# [Bear with me or Bare with me](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/bear-with-me/)

"Bear with me" is the correct form.
