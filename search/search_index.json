I can't stand the idea of having to save some time to sit and write a full article of something I've done. I need to document at the same time as I develop or learn. As I usually use incremental reading or work on several projects, I don't write one article, but improve several at the same time in a unordered way.

In the beginning it was plaintext, then came Markdown, then Asciidoc, I did several refactors to reorder the different articles based in different structured ways, but I always did it with myself as the only target audience.</p> <p>Three years, 7422 articles and almost 50 million lines later, I found Gwern's website and Nikita's wiki, which made me think that it was time to do another refactor to give my wiki a semantical structure, go beyond a simple reference making it readable and open it to the internet.</p> <p>And the blue book was born.</p>"}, {"location": "#contributing", "title": "Contributing", "text": "<p>If you find a mistake or want to add new content, please make the changes.
